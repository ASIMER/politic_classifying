comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of america. that's what i did. and i brought it to the floor of the senate. every democrat voted for it, i got two republicans. we ended up with 56 votes and i couldn't get the 60 votes that i needed. that is pathetic. this was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them. so republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there. what i did next, rachel, is i had to retreat a little bit, i had to compromise. i did work with john mccain. i did work with jeff miller over in the house. and we put together not the bill that i wanted, but probably the most comprehensive v.a. health care bill in the modern history of this country. secretary clinton is absolutely right, there are people, koch brothers among others, who have a group called concerned veterans of america, funded by the koch brothers. the koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy social security, medicare, medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s. yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it. the last point that i'd make. i had a hearing. i had all of the veterans groups in front of me. and i said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the v.a., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good? without exception, what

the united states has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as scalia -- plus there may be at least two other vacancies. so you ask mr. trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would. but the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side. now, if he's changed, we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement. but the bottom line is that, if you don't have a record there to look at and say, \"i feel at peace that when donald trump is president of the united states, he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues.\" in fact, very recently, he was still defending planned parenthood. he says he's not going to take sides in the

political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of assad, a terrible dictator. but i think in syria the

available not just for her, but for all of our children. i have spent a very long time -- my entire adult life -- looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her god-given potential. i've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and i've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. at the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them. and then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one. right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. so i have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families. and i want to do more to help us balance family and work. i believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but i also believe it's about

have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining american democracy, which allows wall street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice. and aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. and that's an economy where ordinary americans are working longer hours for low wagers. they are worried to death about the future of their kids. and yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent. and then in addition to that, the american people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. they see more people in jail in the united states of america than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. we're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow americans. they see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on wall street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. no criminal records for them. i think what our campaign is indicating is that the american people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. they want a political revolution in which millions of americans stand up, come together, not let the trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a

with. we need to repeal obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts americans in charge of their health care money again. if your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in america they want to buy it from. otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country. and if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. and that, i think, is a much better approach than obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy. it is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time. it is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. and i will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all

what president bush and vice president cheney had to say and i didn't believe them. and if you go to my web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what i feared would happen when i spoke on the floor of the house, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. now i think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where secretary clinton and i disagree is the area of regime change. look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the united states, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. and god only knows saddam hussein was a brutal dictator. we could overthrow assad tomorrow if we wanted to. we got rid of gadhafi. but the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after. and in libya, for example, the united states, secretary clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi. but what happened is a political vacuum developed. isis came in, and now occupies significant territory in libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. but this is nothing new. this has gone on 50 or 60 years where the united states has been involved in overthrowing governments. mossadegh back in 1953. nobody knows who mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of iran. he was overthrown by british and american interests because he threatened oil interests of the british. and as a result of that, the shah of iran came in, terrible dictator. the result of that, you had the iranian revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. unintended consequences. so

break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, \"oh, america was right,\" and people are out of work. the fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. when people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. and as president of the united states, i absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the american worker. but we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. people will buy less. other people will be out of work. and we don't want to see that happen. trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, i will stand up and i will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the american

businesses will compete here and not move operations overseas, and also a plan -- the only plan of anybody standing on this stage to get us to a balanced budget by the end of a second term. and, you know, the simple fact of the matter is, we hear a lot of promises in this debate, a lot of promises about these tax cuts or tax schemes sometimes that i call them. hillary and the democrats promise everything on the spending side. we've got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side. yes, lower taxes, lower spending. my website, johnkasich.com, will show you exactly how we balance the budget. i balanced the budget in washington as a chief architect, and i have balanced it in ohio for one reason. when you balance the budget and you cut taxes, people get work. and our most important moral purpose as leaders in the political system is to make sure we create an environment for job creation so people can live their dreams and realize their god-given potential. that's why it's so important. and for those at the bottom, we've got to do what we can to train them so they can move up. but to just look the other way is not acceptable, because, you know what, as the governor of ohio i have to deal with real challenges, and we've gotten it done in our state, and i will do it for america.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.1393814534,-0.7279474735,-0.8415726423,2.1199071407,0.9836076498,-0.5398008227,1.546661377,-0.9898713231,0.1833845526,-0.4645465314,-1.3978903294,-0.024680322,-1.9284527302,1.3819965124,-0.61443156,0.3919739127,-0.5794632435,0.1670522988,-2.2443730831,0.7046989799,-1.0326883793,-0.6270313263,1.2436681986,0.3291935921,-1.2828525305,-0.6194701195,1.3462958336,0.0203879364,1.6505907774,1.1554195881,0.6918303967,0.4669647217,1.5001969337,0.4345491827,0.5421283245,-1.2880187035,1.623557806,1.0498169661,1.7679615021,-0.9397211075,0.5634804964,1.0661450624,-0.4112421274,1.7257055044,1.8963023424,-0.1917084306,0.1218912378,0.2756926417,-0.8079031706,0.072014235]},{"index":217,"text":"millions

you get it? common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget. that gives you economic growth. i did it when i was in washington, as the budget committee chairman, negotiating actually with democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in ohio. but here's the thing that i believe. economic growth is not an end unto itself. we have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise. of course, our friends in the hispanic community, our friends in the african-american community, the promise of america is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone. it's what jack kemp used to say. a rising tide lifts all boats, not just some

with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them. but, what secretary carter is looking at is the constant pressure that russia's putting on our european allies. the way that russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-world war ii europe. the way that he is trying to set european countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in crimea. beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the baltics. we know that they are deeply engaged in supporting assad because they want to have a place in the middle east. they have a naval base, they have an air base in syria. they want to hang on to that. i think what secretary carter is seeing, and i'm glad he is, is that we got to get nato back working for the common defense. we've got to do more to support our partners in nato, and we have to send a very clear message to putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. the best way to do

you didn't go out and get a cab? he said, no, i don't get cabs in washington, d.c. this was 20 years ago. because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. i couldn't believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in washington, d.c. tell you another story, i was with young people active in the black lives matter movement. a young lady comes up to me and she says, you don't understand what police do in certain black communities. you don't understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and i'm not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we've got to hold police officers accountable, i'm just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people. so to answer your question, i would say, and i think it's similar to what the secretary said, when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto. you don't know what it's like to be poor. you don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car. and i believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear. we will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system.","class":0,"tokens":[-2.9197688103,2.3480176926,-1.5200327635,1.3307776451,-0.4600902796,0.2194197178,0.7773055434,0.2619215846,1.2926410437,-0.5500070453,0.0118710427,-0.1905084997,1.0043981075,1.2941697836,-0.4474045634,-1.4491010904,2.1698002815,-1.9640219212,-0.6993026733,-0.0066204267,0.348262012,-0.4726200104,-0.5430245399,-0.3857685924,-0.0969321802,-1.0082864761,-1.3099911213,0.1612960845,-1.6494904757,-0.057711836,0.2747962177,-0.1107838079,-0.2484768629,2.121733427,0.3850451708,-1.5009071827,1.4949355125,0.8661755919,2.67669034,-0.2455687523,-0.8955020308,0.2969029546,-0.1763888001,-1.2047740221,2.2643885612,0.292971313,-2.0710279942,0.3535960019,0.8495672941,0.7811819315]},{"index":499,"text":"that's

in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended. i feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect. trust has been totally lost in a lot of places. at the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically. the young officer who was killed responding to the planned parenthood murders. the officer who told the victims of the san bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them. so i think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that president obama impaneled. we need to get a bipartisan commitment to work

what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace american capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from

secretary clinton never, ever has. in fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with wall street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9\/11. i believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition. there's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages. and the worst type of concentration, secretary clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot. and that's why today you still cannot support, as i do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we

zones for them to stay in the region rather than go to europe. and, that requires american leadership. without american leadership every other country in the neighborhood beings to change their priorities. it is tragic that you see iraq, and other countries now talking to russia. it wasn't that long ago that russia had no influence in the region at all. and, so, the united states needs to lead across the board. this president, and hillary clinton both do not believe the united states has a leadership role to play, and we're now paying a price, and it will have a huge impact on the economy of this country if we don't deal with this.","class":1,"tokens":[0.0220993739,-0.1635504365,0.9822672009,0.5821019411,-1.0599713326,2.3974030018,-0.3177059889,0.8688414097,-1.3944323063,-0.2744088173,-1.0919792652,0.1993794292,1.0243000984,0.1673695147,-0.5520620346,0.029492965,0.1929329485,1.4287064075,0.2651599646,-1.7008748055,0.2141908109,-0.6943448186,-0.0470856801,0.1058224738,-0.3118202388,-0.4368562102,-0.3653625548,-2.708864212,0.8645622134,-0.4207519591,-1.2046310902,2.0800771713,2.0361335278,-0.4698257744,-0.0705998689,-0.6561872959,-1.942602396,-0.7172843218,1.9691493511,0.2955539525,-1.2590337992,1.2746231556,-2.6440415382,-0.4091060758,0.3970670402,2.7625837326,0.6980754137,1.4776718616,-0.7489286065,-0.6724475622]},{"index":558,"text":"first

john kerry, i will say john kerry's foreign policy has been a disaster for decades. that's why i voted against him when he came up. and the fact that donald trump would write him a check and support him against george w. bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment. and i'll give one more example on israel. when the obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of israel, when hamas was raining rockets down on them, i publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against israel? the next day michael bloomberg, another new york billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to israel from london. together the heat and light that was put on the state department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into israel. during that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on israel the natural question is, where was donald? if this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-israel politicians from

the hill. i would prevent them lobbying congress. i don't think the fed should be involved with lobbying us. i think we should examine how the fed has really been part of the problem. you want to study income inequality, let's bring the fed forward and talk about fed policy and how it causes income inequality. let's also bring the fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse. i think the fed has been a great problem in our society. what you need to do is free up interest rates. interest rates are the

not at all. i think that what we're facing with isis is especially complicated. it was a different situation in afghanistan. we were attacked from afghanistan. al qaida was based in afghanistan. we went after those who had attacked us. what's happening in syria and iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in baghdad, led by maliki, there has been a resurgence of sunni activities, as exemplified by isis. and we have to support sunni-arab and kurdish forces against isis, because i believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the united states to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what isis wants. they've advertised that. they want american troops back in the middle east. they want american soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity. so, i think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of american troops into syria and iraq to fight isis. and we do have to form a coalition. i know how hard that is. i have formed them. i put together a coalition, including arabs, with respect to libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto iran. and you have to really work hard at it. and the final thing i would say, bringing donald trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of isis you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition. and so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.","class":0,"tokens":[0.9594624639,-1.3105237484,-1.1534065008,0.2958957553,-0.2651769221,1.4047987461,-1.2380951643,2.3517105579,-1.309948802,0.7184498906,0.1290696263,0.1880644858,0.7520481944,0.8358981013,-2.2481861115,0.1668457687,1.8221408129,-1.0734980106,-1.3079053164,-0.1711092889,-0.7455866337,-0.6278370619,-0.710201323,0.6112471223,-1.2573328018,1.5314543247,-0.9969967604,0.1610760838,0.7686393857,-0.2939174175,-1.6676434278,2.3096966743,0.2938332856,-0.4358285964,0.7721652389,-2.1631650925,-1.6488091946,-0.3890874386,0.5622363091,-1.352973938,1.6568684578,0.430727005,-0.4136801958,-1.8892735243,0.4041906297,0.6565492153,1.0112589598,2.7039251328,0.086503543,-0.7019513845]},{"index":919,"text":"thank

a great question. first of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago. it's an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world. now, the big companies that have connections with washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one tania is talking about, they're the ones that are struggling. the first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses. we need to have a regulatory budget in america that limits the amount of regulations on our economy. we need to repeal and replace obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs. and last but not least, we need to repeal dodd-frank. it is eviscerating small businesses and small

a plan in 1999 to save social security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have social security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts. now there are more

raising the retirement age. if you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on social security, you'll still get it. it will just simply be less. and for those people who depend on that social security, they'll get their full benefit. that's the way it will work. and we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age. and how do i know that? i've done all this

the password of this killer was. and i think they should comply with that. if that's all they're asking for, they are not asking for apple to create a back door to encryption.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.2079324126,-0.411509186,-3.1977343559,0.3329176009,-0.7177608013,1.3379212618,1.3679673672,0.9812667966,0.9027736783,-0.650850594,0.9599223137,0.3290266991,1.422840476,0.5877231359,-1.0034154654,-1.2920205593,-0.4514465928,-1.8445430994,-0.8058636785,-0.2628160119,0.2105986625,-2.1665875912,0.600268662,0.7894755602,0.492862314,-0.8215219975,-1.5615645647,-1.0190906525,0.3044367731,-0.7997322679,-0.4518211484,1.36571455,1.5245399475,0.052177079,-1.4719487429,0.8511150479,-2.0054745674,0.2954635322,1.0520131588,-0.0994782597,-1.5238610506,2.3624558449,-2.6885249615,1.3142414093,-0.1240055487,-0.4352045953,-0.5705205798,0.8194673657,-0.5450788736,-0.5260095]},{"index":1157,"text":"well

discrimination against the lgbt community, with new americans, with people with disabilities. yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society. so i have been moved by my heart ever since i was a young woman about the age of a lot of senator sanders' supporters worrying what i can do to make a difference for my country, and i will bring that heart with me, but i will also tell you we've got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real

security has always been a part of that debate. and it is a fact that the net immigration from mexico and south has basically zeroed out. so, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million

i have what i call the new college compact. because i think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know. number one, states have been dis-investing in higher education. in fact, i think new hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country. so states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education. so under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system. secondly, i don't believe in free tuition for everybody. i believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead. so i have proposed debt free tuition, which i think is affordable and i would move a lot of the pell grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense. so i put all of this together, again, on my website and i've gotten such a good response. but i want to quickly say, one of the areas that senator sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems. free college, a single payer system for health--and it's been estimated we're looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget. and i have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run. and i think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that i have proposed i will tell you exactly how i'm going to pay for it; including college.","class":0,"tokens":[0.0003048983,-0.2692457736,1.5382765532,0.4092139602,0.1027436033,0.7864605784,-0.55195719,0.8859462142,-1.4622297287,1.6128964424,-0.4724414647,0.4756361544,-2.7583303452,-1.7930253744,-1.0734820366,-0.0581387915,-2.5413730145,-0.4720635414,-2.0903801918,-1.8582999706,2.6763453484,-3.44287467,0.3374395967,0.3990048766,3.2316815853,0.0901320204,1.1070680618,2.0949385166,-2.2498281002,-0.3040229976,-0.0457533039,-2.3519601822,3.4251606464,0.2565704584,1.1220536232,-1.9182651043,-0.9608509541,-0.8519610167,-0.5013614893,-0.2498898804,-1.2859004736,0.1757896692,2.3686408997,-0.6192322969,-1.4123510122,0.3544912934,-1.0317720175,0.2543827593,-0.7612951994,0.1743313819]},{"index":1242,"text":"and

i think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be. we have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9\/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in san bernardino and know that we haven't done enough. so we have to go after this both abroad and at home. we have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly isis -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute. we have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from isis. that is principally an american-led air campaign that we are now engaged in. we have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the arabs and the kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from raqqa to ramadi. we have to continue to work with the iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside iraq, like mosul, when they are able to do so. and we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters. and we have to take on isis online. they are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence. here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement. we need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed. but the final thing i want to say about this is the following. you know, after 9\/11, one of the efforts that we did in new york was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it. and we need to do that throughout the country. but we need to understand that american muslims are on the front line of our defense. they are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the american society. so when somebody like donald trump

have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor. but here's the best solution of all. we need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century. why, for the life of me, i do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in america, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work. but the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so americans have the skills for those jobs. but in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers to canada because they can get

of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear dr. king speak in chicago when i was about 14 years old. that got me thinking about what i needed to do to try to fulfill my faith. when i was in law school, i had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named mary right adelman, who worked with dr. king who was the first african-american woman who passed the mississippi bar. i asked her for a job and she said she didn't have any money. i was working my way through law school and she said if i could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. so i got law students a civil rights research council grant. the first thing she did was send me to look at south carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. the second thing she did was to send me to alabama to investigate segregated academies. so from that moment until today, i am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the

that i've very strongly supported that prevents iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war. and that i believe we're seeing a fall in our relationships with iran is a very positive step. so if your question is, do i want to see that relationship become more positive in the future? yes. can i tell that we should open an embassy in tehran tomorrow? no, i don't think we should. but i think the goal has go to be as we've done with cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.","class":0,"tokens":[0.267524004,-1.3019171953,-0.9611071348,1.1312311888,0.924172163,-0.7434006929,-0.7506264448,0.8706049323,-1.5844311714,0.1177472398,0.0706076249,-1.3391904831,-0.2063451111,-0.149239257,-2.0618145466,0.0101462938,-0.0093521057,0.0949567109,-0.3272237778,-2.0235331059,2.2402684689,0.7243167758,-0.6557297111,1.1363689899,-1.9521458149,-0.1360172331,0.2996036112,-0.7730540037,-0.6167402864,-0.8552322388,-0.9233981371,1.0904430151,1.1258318424,-0.7029646039,0.520314455,1.814198494,-0.2322831005,-0.9313817024,2.3690598011,-1.4214235544,0.2171153128,2.9053750038,0.807457149,-0.3380330801,-0.3745870888,-1.2943178415,0.5525880456,1.730091691,-1.038695097,-0.5706288815]},{"index":1416,"text":"well,

guy. now, i may not be successful in doing it. it's probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind. ok? but it doesn't help if i start saying, \"i am very pro-israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage.\" but it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because i would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for israel and for their neighbors. and i can't do that as well -- as a negotiator, i cannot do that as well if i'm taking big, big sides. with that being said, i am totally pro-israel.","class":1,"tokens":[0.3978803456,0.6392705441,0.6751620173,-0.0108385161,0.1125276834,-1.3698329926,0.0117524285,0.8068441153,-2.6958255768,0.0796739683,0.628646791,-2.2138640881,0.2374836802,0.2754426599,-2.0032486916,-0.4274957776,-0.73990798,-1.2183851004,-1.2118005753,-1.4921308756,-0.2976012826,-0.9072099328,0.1572053581,0.619689703,0.1954880357,0.7296231389,0.8483775854,-1.2856277227,0.8912314177,0.1377407908,0.0659520552,0.9130669832,0.9514957666,-0.9753340483,-0.3999713957,1.1033346653,-0.0137905926,0.630515337,0.920501709,0.8147659302,-0.34906286,-0.1874556094,-0.1469017714,-0.5261921883,-1.6503227949,0.6981168389,-1.134554863,-1.850949645,0.6049236059,-1.4286595583]},{"index":1467,"text":"and

1.2 percent a year on average. the obama economy is a disaster, and the imf is telling us this is a new normal. it doesn't have to be. if you look at the history of america, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth. the first is tax reform. and as you noted, i have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every american that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade. the second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses. and the third element is sound money. every time we've pursued all three of those -- whether in the 1920s with calvin coolidge or the 1960s with jfk or the 1980s with ronald reagan -- the result has been incredible

you can, because african-americans and latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. so, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. but it is a general economic issue. and here's what the economic issue is. the wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. why is that? because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate america through nafta and permanent normal trade relations with china, secretary clinton and i disagree on those issues. but view is those trade policies have enabled corporate america to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. but you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits. you once had a pension. those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. they're off to china. now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone. what have you got now? you are working at mcdonald's? that is why there is massive despair all over this country. people have worked their entire lives. they're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all. and that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down. suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous

into our computers. they're building artificial islands in the south china sea, the most important shipping lane in the world. a gangster in moscow is not just threatening europe, he's threatening to destroy and divide nato. you have radical jihadists in dozens of countries across multiple continents. and they even recruit americans using social media to try to attack us here at home. and now we have got this horrible deal with iran where a radical shia cleric with an apocalyptic vision of the future is also guaranteed to one day possess nuclear weapons and also a long-range rocket that can hit the united states. these are extraordinarily dangerous times that we live in. and the next president of the united states better be someone that understands these issues and has good judgment

complete the border. you let people know that once it's done, you don't have a right to come in. if you come in, we don't want any excuse. you're going to go back. but i favor a guest worker program.

some back taxes, maybe some community service. and at the end, i'd give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship. i don't think we're going to tear families apart. i don't think

let's be practical. let's start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs. with president reagan and george bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and i

defeating him by one. there were also pretty large margins in iowa and wisconsin. these are polls. polls go up. polls go down. but here's why i think i will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process. republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. i believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout. if there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the white house, but i think we regain the senate. we win governors' chairs up and down the line. so i believe if you want to retain the white house, if you want to see democrats

very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship. i was very proud of that. we got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that qadafi had, getting it out of libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups. we also worked to help them set up their government. we sent a lot of american experts there. we offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military. they, at the end, when it came to security issues, wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, european or other countries, in libya. and so we were caught in a very difficult position. they could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn't want to have others helping to provide that security. and the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country. and we can't walk away from that. we need to be working with

think -- i think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement. we both believe there has to be more money going into the social security system. i've said i'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the social security trust fund. i have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. first, rather than expand benefits for everyone, i do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. i want to take care of women. when the social security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. and women have been disadvantaged ever since. they do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. and the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their social security monthly payment. so we have no disagreement about the need to buttress social security, get more revenue into the program. but i want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for

name is martin o'malley, former mayor of baltimore, former governor of maryland, a life long democrat, and most importantly, a husband, and a father. my wife katie and i have four great kids, grace, and tara, and william and jack. and, like you, there is nothing we wouldn't do to give them healthier and better lives. there are some things that i have learned to do better in life than others. and, after 15 years of executive experience, i have learned how to be an effective leader. whether it was raising the minimum wage, making our public schools the best in america, passing marriage equality, the dream act, and comprehensive gun safety legislation, i have learned how to get things done because i am very clear about my principals. thanks to president obama, our country has come a long way since the wall street crash of 2008. our country's doing better, we are creating jobs again. but we elected a president, not a magician, and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now. for there is a -- deep injustice, an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart, and it will not solve itself. injustice does not solve itself. what i'm talking about is this, our middle class is shrinking. our poor families are becoming poorer, and 70 percent of us are earning the same, or less than we were 12 years ago. we need new leadership, and we need action. the sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all american families. our economy isn't money, it's people. it's all of our people, and so we must invest in our country, and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families, instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt. and, we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity. the future is what we make of it. we are all in this together. and, the question in this election is whether you and i still have the ability to give our kids a better future. i believe we do, that is why i am running for president, and i need your help. thank you.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.9771997333,0.9595727921,-1.2044551373,1.8110183477,-2.4520230293,1.6044408083,0.2830106318,-1.4404952526,0.4419568777,-1.2389792204,1.1411451101,-1.1363828182,-0.0836975127,0.1149695739,-0.3439426422,0.8690407276,-0.647516191,0.7693805695,-1.8873747587,-2.2087285519,1.42527318,0.2356266975,-0.8362330198,0.8179677129,-0.2552453578,0.0572505333,3.3247332573,-0.518119514,0.8458331227,-0.8750015497,-1.7567322254,-0.5028352737,1.6529461145,0.4078969657,2.2105808258,0.8676092625,0.2979745269,-1.4596452713,0.1465455294,-0.6890745759,-1.142398715,-2.1999833584,-0.9681924582,0.6974836588,2.9617218971,-0.4621377587,1.0918934345,-2.4013113976,-1.8763289452,0.8882520199]},{"index":2011,"text":"since

safer, that's healthier, where they have more opportunity than our parents and grandparents gave to us. tonight, what you listened to was a healthy exchange of ideas about how we'd do that, that which we have always proven, the capacity to do better than any nation in the world, to take actions that include more of our people more fully in the economic, social and political life of our country. when you listened to the republican debate the other night, you heard a lot of anger and you had a lot of fear. well, they can have their anger and they can have their fear, but anger and fear never built america. we build our country by adopting wage and labor policies, including comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway of citizenship for all. we do it by investing in our country, by investing in infrastructure, by investing in the skills and the talents of our people with debt-free college, and we can do it again. and we also create a better future for our kids when we square our shoulders to the great challenges of our times, whether it's terror trying to undermine our values or republican presidential candidates trying to get us to surrender our freedoms and our values in the face of this threat. the other big challenge we have is climate change. the greatest business opportunity to come to the united states of america in 100 years. we need to embrace this. i have put forward a plan that does this, that moves us to 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050. join this campaign for the future. new leadership is what our country needs to move us out of these divided and

problems that keep families up at night. i'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our republican counterparts. from my perspective, we have to prevent the republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made. they would repeal the affordable care act, not improve it. they would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and

freedom act expands that so now we have cell phones, now we have internet phones, now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys. you know what the obama administration keeps getting wrong is whenever anything bad happens they focus on law-abiding citizens instead of focusing on the bad guys. we need to focus on radical islamic terrorists and we need to stop them before they carry out acts of terror.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.7447872758,0.56004107,-1.8104665279,-2.3815975189,1.0869402885,1.6947342157,0.378746897,3.0087015629,-1.0294562578,-0.9376789927,-0.3062175512,1.0568099022,0.6151629686,1.7496464252,-0.1892037988,-2.4144353867,-1.1161571741,-0.9438913465,0.1335799247,1.6611971855,-0.9286814332,0.4653693736,2.5675239563,0.4278328419,0.6361019611,2.1865715981,1.064029336,0.7396577001,2.0130877495,-0.3089881241,-0.41455248,1.4663777351,2.1748418808,-1.2294455767,-1.5572814941,0.1794022024,-3.707903862,0.6585502625,1.9192118645,-1.0438059568,0.1128979325,-0.8666229248,-1.31278193,1.5343436003,-0.6435563564,-1.9000314474,0.0157875083,1.2141724825,0.0365631282,1.6416803598]},{"index":2120,"text":"where

cut taxes, got it done. changed welfare, went around the president to get welfare reform done. there are ways to do it without having to shut the government down, but i'm sympathetic to the fact that

terrorist movements to move in there. and the third was the recent deal allowing iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region

let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they're related. as i've said many times before, my parents were never rich people. my father was a bartender. my mother was a maid. they worked for a living. but they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves. we call that the american dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. it is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people. what makes america special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful. the problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. if i thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, i would be all for it, but it isn't. in the 20th century, it's a disaster. if you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine. and that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated. here's the best way to raise wages. make america the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. for the life of me, i don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education. welders make more money than philosophers. we need more welders and less philosophers.","class":1,"tokens":[0.5779926777,1.4585568905,0.5435078144,0.9324170947,-0.492507726,1.0461574793,1.1285376549,0.9043094516,0.4671232402,-0.9600837231,-0.0582697056,-1.4491076469,-1.3822699785,1.7958570719,-2.1904158592,1.5669000149,-0.346631825,0.5547378063,-2.0700905323,-1.8323633671,0.790895462,0.2874979973,-0.0705750957,1.5245388746,3.1532125473,0.054250434,-0.2799713314,0.1058915854,-0.6113811731,-0.8137136102,-0.3343186975,-0.5086362958,2.9595036507,0.3424747288,-0.9645552635,-1.0355887413,0.5604721904,0.2716631889,0.4813382328,-0.2785387337,-1.2525970936,-2.0936882496,-1.3084443808,0.5371009707,2.179766655,-0.7155659199,1.4922945499,-2.1019966602,-0.5740703344,-1.1484311819]},{"index":2212,"text":"but

forward. so what i would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this. as president, i would make the administrator of usaid an actual cabinet member. we have

created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of syria and iraq. we cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of

government to enforce our immigration laws, and we will not be able to do anything on immigration until we first prove to the american people that illegal immigration is under control. and we can do that. we know what it takes to do that. it takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. it takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. it takes a mandatory e-verify system and a mandatory entry\/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. after we have done that, the second thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal immigration system. and after we have done those two things, i think the american people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn't otherwise violated our laws -- because if they're a criminal they can't stay. they'll have to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. and ultimately, they'll given a work permit and that's all they're gonna be allowed to have for at least 10 years. but you can't get to that third step until you have done the other two things, and that was the lesson we learned in 2013. there is no trust that the federal government will enforce the law. they will not support you until you see it done

reverse course by creating a strategy of high sustained economic growth, not the new normal of 2 percent that all the left says we just have to get used to, but a 4 percent growth strategy where we reform how we tax, fix the broken regulatory system, embrace the energy revolution in our midst, fix the immigration system so we can turn it into an economic driver, deal with the structural fiscal problems that exist because of our entitlement problems that will overwhelm and create way too much debt. if we grow at 4 percent, people are going to be lifted out of poverty. the great middle that defines our country will have a chance to be able to pursue their dreams as they see fit. that should be the great challenge and the great opportunity for the next president of the united states, to forge consensus to go back to a high-growth strategy. and then we'll be able to lead the world. without a high-growth strategy, our country will never have the resources or the optimism to be able to

liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the second amendment right to keep and bear arms from the constitution. now, i think the voters of texas, the voters across super tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this -- this stage. in the past, republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists. so i'm certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that. but the reality is, democrats bat about 1,000. just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want. republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster. i've spent my whole life fighting to defend the bill of rights and the constitution. i can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the second amendment, they're asking the question: who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court? i give you my word, every justice i nominate will vigorously defend the bill of rights for my children and for yours.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.1869983673,1.1493390799,2.6173069477,1.0562449694,1.0372554064,0.1723129898,1.5616846085,1.1269891262,1.257519722,-2.2465910912,1.9133194685,2.2213757038,1.6268451214,0.3622326851,1.5179151297,-2.4990608692,-2.2015714645,-1.8465863466,-3.3477389812,0.0089682247,-0.1982886344,0.4692646861,0.199528724,-0.3471139371,0.0883694515,-0.8969422579,-0.7448781133,-0.0164661258,1.0434994698,0.3388249278,-2.3996829987,-1.5892913342,0.3778330386,-1.1532218456,1.3391399384,0.260886848,-0.0312198959,0.9065765738,0.8589124084,0.6400494576,0.2980871201,0.5996097326,-0.3812186122,1.7877286673,-0.6625339389,1.5759236813,-0.5862336755,-1.657402277,-0.2353656888,0.7932183743]},{"index":2475,"text":"thank

safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps

healthcare. i want to build on the progress we've made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage. and i don't want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar. so we have a difference. i also believe in affordable college, but i don't believe in free college, because every expert that i have talked

with respect to syria, i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made. the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria. the agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to. you know, the russians wanted to buy time. are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. but i would add this. you know, the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution. at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together. this is incredibly complicated, because we've got iran as a big player, in addition to russia. we have saudi arabia, turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. this is one of the areas i've disagreed with senator sanders on, who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria, which i think would be a grave mistake. putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me. trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. so let's support what secretary kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. and remember, the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups. so as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and the like. so we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the russians.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.7943344116,-3.3819582462,-0.26380983,-0.4233391285,1.1177026033,-1.2101496458,-0.8379225731,1.1200017929,-3.3313629627,0.0137973838,0.2440641373,-0.3587491214,0.6511808634,1.7791460752,-0.380261153,-0.4730643332,0.4635457993,-2.9078435898,-1.9440802336,-4.1067581177,-1.6237940788,0.6958110332,-0.4917888641,2.321927309,-0.3686594367,-0.7291930318,-0.4712065756,1.5250959396,0.3582153618,1.3236919641,-1.2126441002,3.5261909962,-1.3182798624,-1.1375120878,2.7178034782,0.7964701056,-3.1326158047,-3.2482020855,-0.8015754819,0.5693538189,2.3557863235,3.4323792458,0.4783689678,-2.3115069866,0.0985749215,-0.425481528,0.0820961446,0.6468818188,-2.0159869194,-1.4412595034]},{"index":2783,"text":"megyn,

not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills. when my parents came, they had a very limited education. my father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. and he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. and i'm grateful every day that america welcomed them. but today in the 21st century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don't have skills is very difficult. we need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on h-1b, particularly on green cards. the primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st century should be, what skills do you have? what business are you going to open? what investment are you going to make? what job are you going to be able to do when you

restrain ourselves. i mean, i know secretary clinton was gleeful when gadhafi was torn apart. and the world, no doubt is a better place without him. but look, we didn't know what was happening next. and we fell into the same trap with assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, assad must go. we have a role to play in this world. but we need to leave the cold war and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.","class":0,"tokens":[-1.0552440882,-2.0813090801,0.2290322781,-0.161627233,-0.6545308232,2.3692932129,-1.0379146338,2.6028716564,0.5574987531,-2.4567060471,0.4609921277,-1.4274560213,-0.971006155,-0.3796897233,-1.4560264349,-2.2666292191,2.2317538261,-1.7772120237,0.5291396976,-2.7382097244,0.6296525598,-0.9049357772,-0.4950677156,0.8083549738,-0.4285595715,0.6743562818,-0.1631000191,-1.0096725225,0.2733686864,1.4868861437,0.3467786014,1.7554131746,1.8421169519,-1.2041473389,-0.0203694683,1.4598382711,-0.5640536547,-1.5405805111,-1.0942188501,-0.8134390712,-3.0945014954,-0.5681177378,0.1045565307,-1.4484820366,-0.8575337529,0.2404222935,0.1828810126,1.6770919561,0.4380183816,-0.5879567266]},{"index":2868,"text":"i

me tell you this, mr. baker, in terms of the cyber attacks, we have the capability to not only have a defensive posture, but it also to make it clear to people that if you attack us with cyber attacks, we will destroy the mechanisms that you are using to attack us. i want to give you a little trip around the world. i served on the defense committee for 18 years. in the ukraine, arm the people there so they can fight for themselves. in the eastern part of europe, make sure that finland and the baltics know that if the russians move, we move. in syria, yes, a no-fly zone in the north on the turkish border, a no-fly zone on the south on the jordanian border. anybody flies in the first time, maybe they can fly out. they fly in there a second time, they will not fly out. and it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be. and it also sends many messages in the middle east that we're still involved. saudi arabia, cut off the funding for the radical clerics, the ones that preach against us. but they're fundamentally our friends. jordan, we want the king to reign for 1,000 years. egypt, they have been our ally and a moderating force in the middle east throughout their history. in the groups -- in the countries of the gulf states of bahrain, the cleveland clinic is opening an operation. clearly we see the same with them. and in israel, we have no better ally in the world, and no more criticizing them in public, we should support them. and finally china, china doesn't own the south china sea, and i give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more. and in the trade agreement, the tpp, it's critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the chinese. they are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend. and finally, i will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics. when the fall comes, and we run against hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected. i have two 16-year-old girls, and i want this country to be strong. we make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble. we must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid. i served in washington as the chairman of the budget committee, and we got the budget balanced. and in ohio, as the ceo, and guess what, we have got to have a ceo mentality and a way to beat hillary clinton and the democracies in the fall. and our ideas have to add up. they have to be solid. and people have to know we have the confidence to lead america. and as president, i will lead this country, as i have before in washington and in ohio, and will return both on domestic and international affairs. and i appreciate the opportunity to speak this time, gerry.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.3629809618,-1.0006216764,-1.1846957207,0.4327906072,-0.0247336496,-1.7678135633,0.8671007156,-0.7483062148,-0.6973034143,0.2019038796,-0.7517911792,-1.3355865479,-0.449475497,-0.1650120616,-0.2193112075,0.0779609755,-0.6275520921,-0.3454479575,-1.7983875275,-2.4201452732,-1.07713902,1.2468918562,0.5828371048,-0.834620595,-1.5307136774,0.210587576,-0.2156395912,-1.5719044209,2.0940582752,1.9176546335,-1.3265393972,0.4795190096,1.4225234985,1.2493708134,0.304651618,-2.855689764,-1.4240134954,-2.9225025177,0.088909328,-0.2477733642,-1.6815998554,-1.0534044504,-3.5653803349,0.7754837275,0.6030731797,-0.1752737463,-1.3915508986,0.591529429,0.6058009863,-1.0781469345]},{"index":2909,"text":"we

this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people. what the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people. we're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in america. that's what the political revolution is about.","class":0,"tokens":[0.0793283433,-0.1209339127,0.668012917,1.1093016863,-0.5232357979,0.6667388678,1.0153229237,-0.463578552,0.4444776773,-0.304050982,-0.2824834585,-0.8471531868,-0.2616217136,0.9749597311,0.2693959475,-0.589163661,1.3284779787,1.2835254669,-1.5477262735,-0.6378244758,0.3721132874,-0.4764887393,0.2562481463,-0.6099712849,1.2365994453,-0.5034226775,0.2869938314,2.0827102661,-0.5025506616,-0.5295063257,-0.6723122001,1.8575011492,-0.4930824935,1.0528351068,-0.1753623784,1.4834207296,-0.7930517793,-0.2288584411,1.3918890953,0.264482379,0.5395951271,1.0026293993,-1.2601066828,0.6200950146,1.272832036,-0.4308277369,-1.2348825932,0.4217167199,0.5586853027,0.3188772798]},{"index":2968,"text":"but

let me give you a little bit of background here. the dnc has hired vendors. on two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago. our staff found information on our computers from the clinton campaign. and when our staffers said, whoa, what's going here? they went to the dnc quietly. they went to the vendor and said, hey, something is wrong, and that was quietly dealt with. none of that information was looked at. our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing. a few days ago a similar incident happened. there was a breach because the dnc vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign. in this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked at that information. as soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person. we are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved. thirdly, what i have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, i recognize it as a problem. but what the dnc did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign. that is an egregious act. i'm glad that late last night, that was

encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. those are the fuels that drive it. and what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. if we can get that out, it makes a big difference. and even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. and it's shifted to the individual. so -- and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich. they go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it. and the middle class, when they come to the cash register, have a whole cart full of things that cost 5, 10 or 15 cents more, they notice it. it is hurting the poor. bernie sanders and hillary clinton won't tell you that that's the thing that's really hurting middle class in the core. they'll say it's the rich, take their money, but that won't help. you can take all of the rich's money and it won't make a dent in the problem that we're having. we have to come back to the fundamental principles that made america great.","class":1,"tokens":[0.5396289825,0.1235052198,-2.4528157711,-1.0990988016,0.7347300053,0.0072314078,-1.4706491232,0.6392805576,0.0412726179,-0.1990315765,0.0011723327,-2.0194711685,0.87291646,0.3647614121,-0.5788221955,3.3631014824,0.4520118237,0.3876308203,-3.714363575,0.9501572251,-1.0185946226,-0.9890226126,-1.4299843311,0.0677921847,1.0902843475,1.8201453686,1.1550370455,0.9729569554,-3.6461257935,-1.1980954409,-1.0619677305,0.7480537891,0.9811992645,0.4014787078,-0.5360597968,-1.3291071653,-0.3350170255,-1.0624084473,1.6304403543,-0.2850998044,-0.5754549503,-0.7244592309,-0.1448035985,-1.6207379103,0.1912480146,2.9432752132,0.9023714066,-1.6967988014,1.7626922131,-0.117674239]},{"index":3080,"text":"here

i'm going to take on the healthcare barriers. i'm going to do everything i can to make sure that we unite our country. i will find common ground, just as i have as first lady, as senator and secretary

concerned, people need to be educated on the minimum wage. every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases. it's particularly a problem in the black community. only 19.8 percent of black teenagers have a job, who are looking for one. you know, that -- and that's because of those high wages. if you lower those wages, that comes down. you know, i can remember, as a youngster -- you know, my first job working in a laboratory as a lab assistant, and multiple other jobs. but i would not have gotten those jobs if someone had to pay me a large amount of money. but what i did gain from those jobs is a tremendous amount of experience, and how to operate in the world and how to relate to different people, and how to become a responsible individual. and that's what gave me what i needed to ascend the ladder of opportunity in this country. that's what we need to be thinking about. how do we allow people to ascend the ladder of opportunity, rather than how do we

unfortunately. they set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum. not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. and we also want parental advisers in the

to nafta because i understood -- i don't think this is really rocket science. we heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created. i didn't believe that for a second because i understood what the function of nafta, cafta, pntr with china, and the tpp is, it's to say to american workers, hey, you are now competing against people in vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage. i don't want american workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour. i don't want companies shutting down in america, throwing people out on the street, moving to china, and bringing their products back into this country. so, do i believe in trade? of course, i believe in trade. but the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate america, for corporate america, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in america lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, \"hey, you don't want to take a cut in pay? we're going to china.\" workers today are working longer hours for lower wages. trade is one of the reasons for that.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.3522676229,1.2487468719,-0.8286697865,0.712893784,0.6515515447,-0.3651746511,-1.8061720133,2.1350331306,0.6652525663,1.113048315,1.16857481,-1.3316940069,-0.9755890965,0.1833507568,-1.3484431505,0.42014727,2.1422333717,0.794552207,-1.5953059196,1.5894761086,-1.1337987185,-0.964181006,0.7252829075,-1.5535827875,0.2838152349,-0.2271347344,-0.7785456777,-1.3852802515,0.1540254802,-2.5695617199,-0.4883969426,-0.4087424278,1.6318378448,1.1484050751,0.792560041,-1.5510168076,0.7120146751,1.5747363567,3.4390444756,0.6221787333,-1.0100705624,-0.3908127844,-1.519741416,-0.4847780168,1.5329970121,1.0445654392,-1.6228243113,3.5021753311,1.6258419752,-0.5993280411]},{"index":3309,"text":"and

i support free trade deals that are good for america. we're 5 percent of the world's population. if all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. we have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things. the problem is we're a low-tariff country. to import something into the united states is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. and so i am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that america can sell things to all these people around the world. there are good trade deals and there are bad ones. so for example, here in florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with colombia. it's allowed flower exporters to come into the united states but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. we have a surplus with colombia. on the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. bottom line is i believe that america, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. if it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the

we are doing away with private health insurance premiums. so, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to blue cross, or blue shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes,

first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of america safe. i have a plan that i've put forward to go after isis. not to contain them, but to defeat them. and it has three parts. first, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both syria and iraq. secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism. and thirdly, to do more to keep us safe. under each of those three parts of my plan, i have very specific recommendations about what to do. obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an american-led air campaign, we have to have arab and kurdish troops on the ground. secondly, we've got to go after everything from north africa to south asia and beyond. and then, most importantly, here at home, i think there are three things that we have to get right. we have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information. that now includes the internet, because we have seen that isis is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence. that means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies. they can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists. we've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning. and we must work more closely with muslim-american communities. just like martin, i met with a group of muslim-americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization. they will be our early warning signal. that's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the republicans have been doing.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.036993999,-1.8854310513,-1.0857876539,-0.2560068965,-0.2543561757,-0.2850125432,-1.3528249264,0.7453527451,-1.0746073723,-0.0558443815,-1.6510126591,1.0539813042,0.6674187183,1.5335916281,-3.4077174664,-2.1667289734,-2.0352869034,-1.3654385805,-0.6229336858,-1.2947230339,0.1072276533,0.7164267898,0.9667956233,0.9027588367,-1.7161529064,-0.6244308949,2.0313613415,-0.2661460638,-0.3383328021,-0.1727769673,0.4328524172,1.8814684153,1.4347612858,1.2376725674,-0.0387842953,-0.7697822452,-2.0570006371,-0.3029553294,-1.1885663271,-2.8824100494,1.3124067783,1.0479480028,-0.1612226367,0.2055325806,0.8998790979,-1.8991917372,1.2706295252,1.5353062153,-0.48274827,-1.2377204895]},{"index":3389,"text":"...wait

are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose. i met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities. so this is a major epidemic, and it has hit new hampshire and vermont particularly hard. i've had had two town halls, one in keene, one in laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do. and i've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out. and i was proud to get the endorsement of mayor walsh of boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena. so, i've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together. i would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and i really applaud governor hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan. we need to do more on the prescribing end of it. there are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction. and we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we

right path. now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the arab spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that isis and other terrorist groups do. but what we're seeing happening in libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among libyans themselves to try to dislodge isis from sirte, the home town of gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government. you know, this is not easy work. we did a lot to help. we did as much as we could because the libyans

to stand up, turn off the tv, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country. please go to berniesanders.com. please become part of the political revolution. thank

they're actually talking now about negative interest. the money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in new york. and because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. so what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality. we also find that as the federal reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst. so really we need to reexamine whether we not -- we want a federal reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates. we also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse. but the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a

worked. out of regime change you get chaos. from the chaos you have seen repeatedly the rise of radical islam. so we get this profession of, oh, my goodness, they want to do something about terrorism and yet they're the problem because they allow terrorism to arise out of that chaos.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.2501058578,-0.4383158386,-0.782110393,1.0679858923,-0.6141657829,2.8920295238,-0.847938776,1.7017371655,-0.7119042873,-0.1232891753,-0.2744109929,0.749438107,0.8458308578,0.930906713,-1.3047397137,0.4829882383,1.4547581673,-1.758664608,0.8924224973,-1.2086747885,-0.3724539876,1.5050634146,0.5110347867,0.3118745387,-0.6457666755,0.2203361541,-1.4389184713,1.2418879271,-0.5726383328,0.1606220454,-2.257983923,0.6458044648,-0.0017469416,-0.7378407717,0.4610072076,-0.240432784,-2.9481651783,-1.0285260677,1.5380715132,-0.2093073875,-0.1934141219,1.8691841364,-0.6680235863,-1.8194056749,0.0664584115,0.8036898971,-0.0612962879,0.1727219224,0.2898227572,-0.4839634001]},{"index":3646,"text":"i

divides. and we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in america over the next ten years. as governor, we continued to work together. we reduced violent crime to 30-year lows. but get this. we also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows. so it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police. but there wasn't a single day as mayor of baltimore that i wasn't asked whether i was delivering on the promise i made to police the police. we reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force. in fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force. as a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable. just as we require every

elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime. that is not what america should be about. if elected president, i will do everything i can to expand social security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.9531428218,0.7604834437,0.7808191776,0.7584453225,0.7030035853,0.2817092836,0.036864806,1.698798418,0.8557903171,-0.9496911168,-0.4108943343,-0.1036628857,0.3462683558,0.4297899306,-1.4527330399,0.4574765265,0.5356236696,0.2655766606,-1.5516960621,0.3485903442,-0.3766656816,-0.4534218907,0.290183574,-1.9619603157,-0.2463496029,-1.8076153994,1.4124283791,0.6943741441,0.4871946275,-1.3318253756,0.0072254641,0.4021559954,1.4983583689,0.636010468,0.9781800508,-1.9153784513,-0.5748340487,0.2208302915,-0.5526330471,-0.3568197191,-1.6653568745,-0.6782073379,-0.3303538263,-0.288980186,1.1645140648,-0.8649402857,-0.7411191463,-0.6260915399,1.0174393654,0.0014897558]},{"index":3707,"text":"...to

you know, rachel, i think i may not have done the job i should in explaining my record. you know, i did -- when i left the secretary of state's office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, i did go on the speaking circuit. i spoke to heart doctors, i spoke to the american camping association, i spoke to auto dealers, and yes, i spoke to firms on wall street. they wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of state. but what i want people to know is i went to wall street before the crash. i was the one saying you're going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. i called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. i proposed changes in ceo compensation. i called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created. and i think the best evidence that the wall street people at least know where i stand and where i have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary. they have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. hedge fund billionaires, karl rove, another billionaire, jumped in. and why are they doing that? these are guys who try to make smart investments. they know my record, they know me, they know that i say what i believe and i will do it. and i also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them. so i do want people to know that, and i think it's important for everybody to understand i have a record, i have stood firm and i will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the

believe, and they're not moving. and they put their money in the bank, and they got no interest on their money. they receive none. and their sons or daughters are living in the basement because they can't get a good job after they rang up so much college debt. what people are hungry for is, who can fix this? people want to know who -- what can you do to solve the problems in washington, to make sure that we have stronger job growth and better wages? but you know what else they're yearning for? they want to believe that they have the power to fix things where they live, and they want the power back, so they can begin to do things in their community. now, listen, this has been going on for a long time here. and i appreciate the discussion back and forth. but there are a lot of people
