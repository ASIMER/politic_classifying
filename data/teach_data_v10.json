plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. at the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them. and then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one. right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. so i have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families. and i want to do more to help us balance family and work. i believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but i also believe it's about

violent, addicted, and abandoned city in america. and i ran and promised people that together we could turn that around. and we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime, or part one crime by more than any other major city in america over the next 10 years. i did not make our city immune to setbacks. but i attended a lot of funerals, including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor african-american neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner. we've saved over a thousand lives in baltimore in the

call, the charleston loophole. he voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the nra said, \"was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. \" he voted to let guns go onto the amtrak, guns go into national parks. he voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives. let's not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country. that's 33,000 people a year. one of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered. now, i am pleased to hear that senator sanders has reversed his position on

you get it? common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget. that gives you economic growth. i did it when i was in washington, as the budget committee chairman, negotiating actually with democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in ohio. but here's the thing that i believe. economic growth is not an end unto itself. we have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise. of course, our friends in the hispanic community, our friends in the african-american community, the promise of america is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone. it's what jack kemp used to say. a rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats. and you know what? with me and the hispanic community, i think they like me. and i appreciate that, because i want them to have the same opportunity that i and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country. it's time to solve problems.","class":1,"tokens":[-1.0175420046,-0.9621558785,0.7348246574,-0.5112551451,-0.004625468,-1.3777068853,-0.1506146789,1.2035306692,0.4739292562,-1.7318460941,0.6751525998,0.3365378082,0.3598516881,-1.1568313837,0.1640529782,0.4347555935,0.800219059,0.9862724543,1.1937457323,2.2973120213,-1.077506423,2.1448111534,-0.8340370059,-0.2402177006,1.4335500002,0.0344147757,1.1383816004,1.154553175,-0.5151780248,-2.1270046234,-0.477104485,1.7864545584,1.2137440443,-1.1377071142,2.0508122444,1.1591676474,0.8216941357,-0.0154572818,1.9106231928,0.1226188242,0.0875720307,-2.3103034496,-1.4968383312,0.2557145059,1.2369788885,-0.8463475704,-0.5747635365,1.606233716,2.067255497,0.381603241]},{"index":394,"text":"well

can continue to do so from any company in america they want to buy it from. otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country. and if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. and that, i think, is a much better approach than obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy. it is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's

that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. and who can blame them? they pay tax once overseas. they don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back. so beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money. bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the united states. we'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. and i would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country. it would not necessitate us raising any taxes. it would bring the money back into the united states to help build jobs by american companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and

him against george w. bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment. and i'll give one more example on israel. when the obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of israel, when hamas was raining rockets down on them, i publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against israel? the next day michael bloomberg, another new york billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to israel from london. together the heat and light that was put on the state department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into israel.

non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on. so we have a problem. and the very first speech i gave in this campaign was about what i will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration. so i think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, senator sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from. so that's how i see it. and i think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.","class":0,"tokens":[1.2252966166,0.7669662833,-0.6168454289,-2.2073953152,1.3693236113,-1.1227216721,2.2955091,-0.0464876182,1.6448568106,-0.7452725768,-0.7641490698,-0.6124390364,-1.0268876553,-0.2994970381,0.5549649596,-1.1874406338,-0.0807145983,1.061882019,2.0099720955,-1.0301327705,-1.6848088503,0.3647964597,-0.3669574559,1.3687036037,2.1524906158,2.1431031227,0.7468377948,-0.1804165542,0.1244457215,0.4868635237,1.4042278528,-1.099322319,-1.3054485321,-0.1331329942,1.8052723408,0.7095273733,0.6957936883,-0.5330039859,0.3077210486,1.4661837816,0.4013521671,-0.0683213994,-0.982668519,1.0843036175,-0.3389463723,-1.3612649441,-0.2098129392,-0.8742904067,0.0945892334,2.1591377258]},{"index":652,"text":"...

what president bush and vice president cheney had to say and i didn't believe them. and if you go to my web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what i feared would happen when i spoke on the floor of the house, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. now i think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where secretary clinton and i disagree is the area of regime change. look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the united states, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. and god only knows saddam hussein was a brutal dictator. we could overthrow assad tomorrow if we wanted to. we got rid of gadhafi. but the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after. and in libya, for example, the united states, secretary clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi. but what happened is a political vacuum developed. isis came in, and now occupies significant territory in libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. but this is nothing new. this has gone on 50 or 60 years where the united states has been involved in overthrowing governments. mossadegh back in 1953. nobody knows who mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of iran. he was overthrown by british and american interests because he threatened oil interests of the british. and as a result of that, the shah of iran came in, terrible dictator. the result of that, you had the iranian revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. unintended consequences. so

our homes. the country has to be able to lock its doors as well. so, we -- i have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration. i would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. and if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. no excuses because we can't continue this problem. i think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home. and i think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization. not to citizenship. i believe that program can pass the congress in the first 100 days. but let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of america is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget. we can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in america, all the people who are citizens of america, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that i used in washington. and guess what, i've used it in ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since i've been

of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear dr. king speak in chicago when i was about 14 years old. that got me thinking about what i needed to do to try to fulfill my faith. when i was in law school, i had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named mary right adelman, who worked with dr. king who was the first african-american woman who passed the mississippi bar. i asked her for a job and she said she didn't have any money. i was working my way through law school and she said if i could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. so i got law students a civil rights research council grant. the first thing she did was send me to look at south carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. the second thing she did was to send

workers and jobs are going overseas. we're driving jobs overseas. and the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. but i'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. this obama administration is negotiating the trade in services agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from americans as well. and you've got to understand. trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. so the question is, what's the solution? it's easy to talk about the problems. but do you have a solution to fix it? and i think the solution is several things. number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting american workers first, not the corporate board room. number two, we need to lift the regulations on american businesses here so we see jobs coming back. and number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan i've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to america.","class":1,"tokens":[2.0261728764,1.6730817556,-0.3808796406,-3.277957201,0.879697144,-0.51756531,2.0414903164,0.6107368469,0.2439008504,-0.552352488,-1.3297224045,0.7556402087,1.9541922808,-1.5253690481,-1.2634961605,0.70323807,0.730651021,-0.4140768051,-1.9026433229,0.6671659946,-1.6617739201,0.3353341222,-0.0843752772,-1.377119422,1.2106188536,2.1334178448,0.8657078147,-1.3546324968,-1.9464277029,1.2532621622,1.3780150414,-1.1091974974,0.5343087912,0.4389411211,-0.3350672424,-1.1101144552,-1.278241396,-0.3309304714,0.9334562421,0.2824858129,-0.0969900265,-1.2554725409,-3.3624947071,-0.6256873608,-0.4978043735,-2.3121068478,-0.6418179274,-1.8223247528,1.546736002,-2.4533882141]},{"index":878,"text":"well,

free.","class":0,"tokens":[0.7068265676,-0.7610397935,-1.6964155436,-0.4085437059,0.6901041865,-1.4071075916,-0.3605083525,-0.6835896969,0.8234568834,-0.3608827591,-1.2669126987,-0.0166457202,0.9147468805,0.1959081143,-1.2159827948,0.216302976,-0.2111480832,0.9572563767,1.1793401241,-0.6539458632,-0.6606574059,0.1486494243,0.0596194044,0.799939692,0.3743405044,1.4316862822,1.6760908365,1.2202447653,0.2912760079,1.5234445333,-0.699811995,-0.6612553,0.8290635347,-0.4438924491,1.3997650146,0.7196187377,-0.0870336518,-1.0458105803,0.5969839692,0.5722529292,-0.5297986269,-1.1244478226,-1.2983839512,0.2598515153,-0.6499317884,-1.0801029205,-0.5262623429,-0.1432888657,0.4211770296,-0.7804906368]},{"index":944,"text":"no,

their child, had a picture. you know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down. or a young woman who had been performing at president obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member. and, of course, i met the mothers of eric garner and tamir rice, and michael brown and trayvon martin and so many of them who have lost their children. so, your original

koch brothers have a very clear political agenda. it is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country. we're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the

gwen and judy, thank you very much for hosting this event. and, pbs, thank you. nine months ago, our campaign began. and when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of vermont. a lot has happened in nine months. and what has happened is, i think, the american people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining american democracy, which allows wall street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice. and aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. and that's an economy where ordinary americans are working longer hours for low wagers. they are worried to death about the future of their kids. and yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent. and then in addition to that, the american people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. they see more people in jail in the united states of america than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. we're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow americans. they see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on wall street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. no criminal records for them. i think what our campaign is indicating is that the american people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. they want a political revolution in which millions of americans stand up, come together, not let the trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors. thank you.","class":0,"tokens":[0.5972831249,-0.4591543674,-0.3466800451,-0.4617512524,0.6753508449,-0.5866299868,-3.3096930981,-1.3588941097,2.67111516,1.1406421661,-0.3344044089,-1.4574074745,0.0484794192,-0.5691723228,0.1478773654,-0.2975751758,-0.2478560209,-0.3845623434,-0.28772524,-0.6284918189,-0.5531348586,1.0450158119,0.0902031064,0.6681450605,0.7572470307,0.1146240234,1.1160039902,0.4118653536,-2.5688145161,-0.3048089445,-0.1518729776,-0.6452018619,2.4811336994,0.048929397,-0.2927489579,1.1982166767,-0.1454108059,-1.6837792397,-0.0095718382,0.771563828,-1.5969897509,0.3602037132,-1.6338305473,-0.1283089668,0.611089468,-0.2006385922,0.9172676206,-2.0977268219,0.5800899267,-2.7264893055]},{"index":982,"text":"and

missile capability. and, i know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach hawaii, if not the west coast. we do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them. but, what secretary carter is looking at is the constant pressure that russia's putting on our european allies. the way that russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-world war ii europe. the way that he is trying to set european countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in crimea. beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the baltics. we know that they are deeply engaged in supporting assad because they want to have a place in the middle east. they have a naval base, they have an air base in syria. they want to hang on to that. i think what secretary carter is seeing, and i'm glad he is, is that we got to get nato back working for the common defense. we've got to do more to support our partners in nato, and we have to send a very clear message to putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. the best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the europeans in so they're actually contributing more to their own

this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit. the world's financial system on the verge of collapse. i think that president obama, vice president biden, and the democratic leadership in the house and the senate have done a fantastic job. we are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago. that's the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go. do i think president obama is a progressive? yes, i do. i disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement. but, yes, i think he has done an excellent job.","class":0,"tokens":[0.6990508437,-0.7339289188,0.0361602902,1.1515407562,0.9781169295,-0.2701872587,-1.698800087,0.5885954499,2.7670037746,0.6687121391,-1.378228426,1.558765769,0.3514411449,-1.5455124378,-0.5397863388,1.0515887737,-0.2470405251,1.1932184696,1.139149189,-1.370708704,-1.8965262175,0.0665759519,0.3276222646,-0.4808144271,0.3237122297,1.6343829632,0.9505375624,-0.393884331,0.7500725389,1.0988391638,-1.5084220171,-0.0689924285,0.4592018723,-0.808085382,1.743412137,-0.864479661,-0.0064986534,-0.207088232,-0.1488185227,0.7948597074,0.217362836,-0.9578465223,-1.0568283796,-1.8244206905,0.4376164675,0.6809668541,2.0225048065,0.2082260847,0.0152318068,-0.2350119501]},{"index":1064,"text":"of

future.","class":0,"tokens":[1.5279355049,1.8775738478,-0.2049075365,-2.2724294662,0.5170315504,-1.7081646919,0.5345368385,-1.5261501074,-0.0747437179,-2.3333034515,0.7420641184,-1.2810205221,0.2078480572,-1.4795931578,0.6759389043,-0.9594907165,-1.2393839359,-1.6165449619,0.9765488505,0.1530701369,-0.693980515,1.0313185453,0.6431062818,-0.4506949186,-0.8494642973,1.5847321749,-0.2834889293,-1.0934517384,-1.5706328154,-1.2716383934,1.1846359968,1.6678506136,0.7357801795,-1.4133695364,2.154156208,0.0044108927,1.5490210056,0.3385700285,-0.4184293151,-0.8310221434,-0.3435395062,1.303016305,1.7815048695,-1.7206859589,0.2877272069,2.0389528275,0.1563398987,0.3978027701,-0.4647583067,0.9499359131]},{"index":1109,"text":"you

with respect to syria, i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made. the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria. the agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to. you know, the russians wanted to buy time. are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. but i would add this. you know, the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution. at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together. this is incredibly complicated, because we've got iran as a big player, in addition to russia. we have saudi arabia, turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. this is one of the areas i've disagreed with senator sanders on, who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria, which i think would be a grave mistake. putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me. trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. so let's support what secretary kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. and remember, the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups. so as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and the like. so we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the russians.","class":0,"tokens":[1.5699877739,1.9948549271,-0.1571649015,-1.296826601,2.4880473614,-1.744482398,0.4031356871,-0.7941944003,1.5906661749,-1.5564126968,1.7117230892,0.590826869,-2.6672852039,-3.1459400654,3.9424836636,-0.1532754749,-1.6444886923,-3.8646719456,2.7833282948,-0.1106830835,-1.4846704006,2.0809044838,-0.4844479859,-1.7063415051,-1.5069777966,1.3131198883,-0.5590361357,-1.0788651705,-1.1129716635,-3.1351315975,0.2421444058,1.9497485161,1.1113448143,1.4561064243,3.2737755775,-1.5271836519,0.8474379778,-0.2720626891,0.5686016083,-1.6737121344,-0.9247512221,3.7749409676,1.4036380053,1.641718626,1.2728850842,2.3191459179,0.1082153395,1.3253779411,-2.063018322,2.5148928165]},{"index":1111,"text":"well,

strengthened the tools of national security and law enforcement to go after terrorists. it gave us greater tools and we are seeing those tools work right now in san bernardino. and in particular, what it did is the prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. when you had a terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily land lines. the usa freedom act expands that so now we have cell phones, now we have internet phones, now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys. you know what the obama administration keeps getting wrong is whenever anything bad happens they focus on law-abiding citizens instead of focusing on the bad guys. we need to focus on radical

i have what i call the new college compact. because i think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know. number one, states have been dis-investing in higher education. in fact, i think new hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country. so states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education. so under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system. secondly, i don't believe in free tuition for everybody. i believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead. so i have proposed debt free tuition, which i think is affordable and i would move a lot of the pell grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense. so i put all of this together, again, on my website and i've gotten such a good response. but i want to quickly say, one of the areas that senator sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems. free college, a single payer system for health--and it's been estimated we're looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget. and i have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run. and i think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that i have proposed i will tell you exactly how i'm going to pay for it; including college.","class":0,"tokens":[0.824318409,3.0938563347,0.4584740698,-1.1717782021,2.4828691483,-0.193618238,-0.8842776418,2.3116230965,0.3501554132,1.0918295383,2.7226538658,0.4231586754,-1.3087730408,0.2035555542,-0.5621253848,0.8142085075,-1.6318947077,2.0006716251,1.8905179501,0.1422129571,-1.8585666418,1.9742324352,1.3132052422,-0.5318720341,0.1197739691,1.1797292233,3.6081614494,1.8899749517,-3.6210370064,-0.59951967,1.6459914446,1.7148315907,-2.7986619473,-1.6419748068,0.3301376104,1.0989180803,0.6208947897,-0.5951431394,1.4887866974,1.4568697214,1.5370768309,-0.213536948,-2.452403307,0.127497524,1.572440505,-0.4117166698,-1.4765216112,0.6203724146,-0.1768463403,0.7575938106]},{"index":1148,"text":"it's

have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor. but here's the best solution of all. we need to

with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work. but the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so americans have the skills for those jobs. but in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers to canada because they can get

i think we should have policies that don't allow them to just enlarge themselves at the expense of smaller entities. and certainly some of the policies, some of the monetary and fed policies that we're using makes it very easy for them, makes it very easy for the big corporations, quite frankly, at these very low interest rates to buy back their stock and to drive the price of that up artificially. those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place. and i think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation. this country was -- declared its independence in 1776. in less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. and the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. those are the fuels that drive it. and what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. if we can get that out, it makes a big difference. and even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. and it's shifted to the individual. so -- and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich. they go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it. and the middle class, when they come to the cash register, have a whole cart full of things that cost 5, 10 or 15 cents more, they notice it. it is hurting the poor. bernie sanders and hillary clinton won't tell you that that's the thing that's really hurting middle class in the core. they'll say it's the rich, take their money, but that won't help. you can take all of the rich's money and it won't make a dent in the problem that we're having. we have to come back to the fundamental principles that made america great.","class":1,"tokens":[-1.8314481974,0.6349524856,-0.6534895897,0.3682061732,2.4392585754,-0.9735225439,0.3047320545,-2.3828427792,-1.2157322168,-0.3938281238,-0.2098689675,2.6120314598,0.7256794572,-1.7097768784,0.7708618045,-1.9173185825,-0.7570652366,-2.0385878086,2.5273160934,0.3838005662,0.3514086008,1.8976057768,1.6302725077,-1.5671844482,-1.8578902483,0.192851007,2.3542702198,0.5048196316,-1.6550474167,2.6574492455,-0.2936550379,-1.245022893,1.5445482731,-0.8846951127,1.7225966454,2.2822644711,1.0223644972,0.705909729,-1.1140832901,0.4494672418,-1.5787521601,0.6844633222,-0.7687562704,0.169810921,-1.8982533216,-0.3626432717,-0.9281811714,-1.770010829,1.0091658831,-1.4801875353]},{"index":1247,"text":"anybody

deals, they should be more effective. i have a fundamental disagreement and i think most republicans and most americans do, that we shouldn't be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to cuba, to go to iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us.","class":1,"tokens":[0.7124693394,0.6898280978,-0.8575695753,-1.1582164764,1.3651083708,-0.9931039214,-0.1210044175,-0.1139546782,1.5710376501,-0.4986625314,-0.3051977158,-0.4476603568,0.9464117885,0.5215739012,-0.2886419296,-0.1221870407,0.0370010547,-0.5702766776,1.35569489,-1.3007690907,-0.9124644399,1.1584349871,-0.1389414519,-1.0013148785,-0.1648564935,0.6375136375,-1.5806461573,0.1639065892,-1.2118240595,0.3545305729,0.1306183934,-0.0166212749,1.5104510784,-0.4736786783,-0.9420203567,0.904053092,1.2856858969,-1.1305743456,-0.4640728533,0.343860507,0.4592732489,1.853677392,-0.9975495934,0.9947116375,0.2920966744,3.0979862213,0.7322297692,1.0463296175,0.8205910921,-0.3974329531]},{"index":1303,"text":"no,

the republicans, i think we should actually expand social security and increase average monthly benefits. but look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains. if we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our

they're actually talking now about negative interest. the money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in new york. and because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. so what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality. we also find that as the federal reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst. so really we need to reexamine whether we not -- we want a federal reserve that's involved so much

clinton way: say whatever you have to, lie as long as you can get away with it. we must beat hillary clinton. carly fiorina can beat hillary clinton. i will beat hillary clinton. and under a president fiorina, we will restore the character of this nation, the security of this nation, the prosperity of this nation, because as citizens, we will take our government

defeating him by one. there were also pretty large margins in iowa and wisconsin. these are polls. polls go up. polls go down. but here's why i think i will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process. republicans win

not only do we retain the white house, but i think we regain the senate. we win governors' chairs up and down the line. so i believe if you want to retain the white house, if you want to see democrats

laden. my view on this is look at my record. look at what i am proposing, and -- we have a vigorous agreement here. we both want to reign in the excesses of wall street. i also want to reign in the excesses of johnson controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes. i want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like valeant, and turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on people's health. now, if all we're going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, we're missing the big oil companies. we're missing other big energy companies. we're missing the big picture, and i have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and i will continue to do that.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.3099735975,1.5640778542,-0.0007661189,-1.2501728535,1.1478042603,-0.1441182196,0.5512751341,-0.3830875754,-1.1442080736,-0.1734160036,-0.4773929715,1.1207939386,1.2168307304,0.5123763084,0.3776456416,-1.6418254375,-0.142494157,-1.4888739586,2.2155480385,0.0289659668,-0.4755430818,0.2751452923,-0.7462905645,0.5997658372,0.8958433867,1.8317385912,1.7678143978,0.3981535733,1.0635871887,1.6083343029,0.442463696,-0.4795309603,0.487698257,0.8692835569,2.2254915237,0.0707668662,0.1023544222,-2.5866808891,1.6763801575,0.4417258799,1.4258276224,0.9826579094,0.0898880213,-0.6770803332,-1.4893531799,0.0356523767,-0.7605454326,0.7246088982,0.5838439465,0.57095927]},{"index":1471,"text":"we're

immigrants. all of my neighbors are immigrants. i see every aspect of this problem. the good, the bad, and the ugly. and here's what we learned in 2013. the american people don't trust the federal government to enforce our immigration laws, and we will not be able to do anything on immigration until we first prove to the american people that illegal immigration is under control. and we can do that. we know what it takes to do that. it takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. it takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. it takes a mandatory e-verify system and a mandatory entry\/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. after we have done that, the second thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal immigration system. and after we have done those two things, i think the american people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn't otherwise violated our laws -- because if they're a criminal they can't stay. they'll have to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. and ultimately, they'll given a work permit and that's all they're gonna be allowed to have for at least 10 years. but you can't get to that third step until you have done the other two things, and that was the lesson we learned in 2013. there is no trust that the federal government will enforce the law. they will not support you until you see it done first.","class":1,"tokens":[0.7409749031,0.596246779,0.415584892,-0.8418889642,2.0300719738,-0.7263192534,0.637214005,0.5527285933,1.2950894833,-0.7714636326,-0.0061788056,0.7445349693,-1.1177765131,1.1345769167,-0.1610955745,0.6173961163,-0.6625314951,0.4349798858,-0.859501183,-0.7218447328,-1.159375906,-0.355913043,-1.3677501678,-0.540442884,1.2526823282,0.4096502662,1.0728423595,-0.5769530535,-1.3270237446,-0.9389131665,-0.2355428785,-0.1130608022,0.6545250416,-0.4706346989,-0.7214590311,-1.2682945728,1.6514334679,0.5255503058,0.1726775914,4.3227763176,1.6889039278,0.5482546687,-1.1959427595,-1.1149679422,-1.5732861757,0.8047760725,-0.7027084231,0.5328187346,2.9161877632,0.1412867308]},{"index":1499,"text":"let's

jobs. i want to take care of women. when the social security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. and women have been disadvantaged ever since. they do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. and the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their social security monthly payment. so we have no disagreement about the need to buttress social security, get more revenue into the program. but i want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting

and let me give you an example. universities today have so many non-academic assets. at ohio state they sold the parking garage and the parking lot, and they got $500 million because they shouldn't be in the parking lot business. they shouldn't be in the ding business, they shouldn't be in the dorm business. and, of course, we need to take advantage of on-line education to reduce these costs and begin to dis-intermediate the cost of four years. now, for those who that have these big high costs, i think we can seriously look at an idea of where you can do public service. i mean legitimate, public service and begin to pay off some of that debt through the public service that you do. and in the meantime, it may inspire us to care more about our country, more about ourselves. this is a big

differences are so stark. you know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that. this is a watershed election. i know how important it is that we have a democrat succeed president obama in the white house. and i will do all that i can in this campaign to reach out and explain what i stand for and what i will do as president. you know, i became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so i spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future. but as president, i will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because i want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her god-given potential. if you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission. thank you, good night and may the force be with you.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.824709177,0.2297646552,-2.0315511227,0.5511838198,1.9896856546,-0.9080064893,-1.0778739452,-0.7750226259,1.8019075394,-0.5749349594,-0.7638263106,-0.0333366096,0.0155074093,0.2090286613,0.6344971657,1.4729081392,-1.965931654,1.0577794313,0.2604603767,-0.2067075521,0.8669385314,-0.3179834485,-0.4445206225,-0.51521945,3.114386797,0.8253848553,0.4306748211,-0.9644655585,-1.051727891,-0.6712653637,-0.8856172562,-0.84883672,1.9352440834,-1.6202685833,1.2403461933,-0.1400703341,0.3331438601,-0.3131226599,0.7438157797,-0.282897383,-2.7725584507,-0.042683024,1.245629549,1.0818663836,0.5624853373,-1.7832958698,-0.0040494069,-0.3602285385,0.1970033497,-0.2324824333]},{"index":1693,"text":"well,

you can, because african-americans and latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. so, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. but it is a general economic issue. and here's what the economic issue is. the wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. why is that? because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate america through nafta and permanent normal trade relations with china, secretary clinton and i disagree on those issues. but view is those trade policies have enabled corporate america to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. but you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits. you once had a pension. those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. they're off to china. now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone. what have you got now? you are working at mcdonald's? that is why there is massive despair all over this country. people have worked their entire lives. they're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all. and that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is
