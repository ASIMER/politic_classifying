you didn't go out and get a cab? he said, no, i don't get cabs in washington, d.c. this was 20 years ago. because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black.

reagan administration. in the senate, i spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one. i also wrote and passed the best piece of veterans education legislation in history, the post 9\/11 g.i. bill. i brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion. i led what later became called the strategic pivot to asia two years before president

on.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.1389243305,-0.1622395664,-0.6126590967,0.3643205464,-0.7302713394,1.1027313471,-0.1653463393,-0.2970107198,-0.9314789176,0.3200404048,0.4248713851,-0.2484166473,0.2740606368,0.3210199773,-0.300973475,-0.2002981305,-1.3815385103,0.5451700687,-0.7662196159,-0.5564934611,0.0103831124,-0.194543764,-0.6422971487,0.2379353642,0.1928946078,-0.3611829281,0.0480255336,0.3794713318,0.6400402188,-0.6385725141,0.1457614899,0.8295174837,0.2582882345,-0.1738662124,0.5067936182,-1.4700659513,0.1790324003,-0.4956865013,0.3331416845,-0.1205713525,-0.5721187592,-0.453379482,0.0436159894,0.1230710298,-0.6514294744,-0.0467138216,0.3462162614,-0.8207612634,0.8221880794,0.5330309868,-0.7705579996,0.805206418,-0.5651569366,-0.5098564029,-0.9926759005,0.522773087,-0.4517993033,-0.3216525316,0.7115797997,0.3665722907,-0.4143542945,0.2093465626,0.8226435184,0.6614362597,0.3004353642,0.5154519677,-0.4694194198,0.1686751395,0.048955068,0.4459296763,-1.1119978428,0.4380759299,-0.3363023102,-0.3261291385,-0.6381411552,-0.0365736783,-0.1424654275,-0.4082826376,-0.1773975044,-0.5693747401,-0.0797521397,-0.3535405993,0.2405598164,0.7422770858,0.6495352387,-0.5387814641,-0.0972912386,-0.4115841985,-0.1661866903,-0.4673469961,-0.243817091,-0.0663155764,-0.3026294112,-0.4917241633,0.3320538402,-0.7104099989,-0.2840959132,0.8241992593,-1.0952651501,-0.4116024971]},{"index":101,"text":"well,

with people in suits. secretary clinton, i have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say there's no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true. i support reinstituting a modern version of glass- steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things. in prior debates i've heard you even bring up -- i mean, now you bring up president obama here in south carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with wall street. in an earlier debate, i heard you bring up even the 9\/11 victims to defend it. the truth of the matter is, secretary clinton, you do not go as far as reining in wall street as i would. and the fact of the matter is, the people of america deserve to have a president that's on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on wall street. and we're just as vulnerable

other universities, i think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have... you know, i recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking. each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture. you know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down. or a young woman who had been performing at president obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member. and, of course, i met the mothers of eric garner and tamir rice, and michael brown and trayvon martin and so many of them who have lost their children. so, your original

investing in infrastructure, by investing in the skills and the talents of our people with debt-free college, and we can do it again. and we also create a better future for our kids when we square our shoulders to the great challenges of our times, whether it's terror trying to undermine our values or republican presidential candidates trying to get us to surrender our freedoms and our values in

course, we have to have people in every community involved in it. we have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in washington. but we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the american people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be

people that have been pouring into the polls, it's, again, the biggest story. you look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening. i am different in one primary respect, and that's trade. i feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals. the jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs. you look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed. so that's that. but i will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country. the devaluations of their currencies by china and japan and many, many other countries, and we don't do it because we don't play the game. and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave. if you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the united states and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs. and if you look at

personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the united states is leading so that we can try to take out isis infrastructure, take out their leadership. and i think that, given the threat that isis poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the sunni tribes in anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the kurds to provide them the support, but they're doing the fighting. we're doing the support and enabling. and i also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take isis on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home. so as i look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me. we just have to keep -- try to get more support for those people on the ground in syria and iraq who have to actually physically take the territory

had been done to them. and i support what president bush did at that time, going into afghanistan, hunting al qaeda and its leaders, getting its sanctuary out of place, and making it as difficult around the world for them to move people and money. and then he went to prosecutors like us, and he said, never again. don't prosecute these people after the crime is committed. intervene before the

the economy growing? how do we bring back economic growth? because economic growth, it's foundational to every other challenge we have. as you rightly noted, from 2008 to today, our economy has grown 1.2 percent a year on average. the obama economy is a disaster, and the imf is telling us this is a new normal. it doesn't have to be. if you look at the history of america, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth. the first is tax reform. and as you noted, i have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every american that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade. the second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses. and the third element is sound money. every time we've pursued all three of those -- whether in the 1920s with calvin coolidge or the 1960s with jfk or the 1980s with ronald reagan -- the result has been incredible economic growth. we have done it before, and with leadership, we can do it

met.","class":0,"tokens":[0.8872461915,0.3618836701,0.3657763004,-0.2237882465,-0.3751603365,0.1673048586,-0.3558936715,0.6156982183,-1.202507019,-0.3616856039,0.0298972949,-0.1536475718,0.7328397632,0.5522051454,1.2517331839,0.6316120625,-0.7698735595,0.0781419799,-1.0463109016,0.0564970002,0.1526700556,-1.0382552147,-0.4019609988,0.0035844273,-0.6163238287,0.3537999094,-1.4726368189,-0.4675419331,0.6186038256,0.4960854053,-0.0267113633,1.0123921633,-0.5322949886,0.302628547,2.1143357754,-0.2327765226,1.336440444,0.3770140409,0.2965937853,-0.6556664705,0.8673154712,-0.5937029123,-1.140185833,0.2659122348,-1.6158379316,1.0160970688,1.2282379866,-0.4948939979,0.5307695866,0.2981630564,0.0066163456,2.0553991795,-0.7790353894,0.0440602191,-0.5018100142,-0.3341704905,0.6961196065,-0.0356761292,1.027843833,-1.2809971571,-0.7777143121,-0.8630622625,-0.3495275378,-1.6131615639,1.0721417665,0.1738845408,-0.6958913803,-0.6331502795,-0.2213609964,-0.9417749047,0.1198342741,-1.6512700319,0.78187567,0.375402987,1.3226537704,-0.3236269951,1.2276059389,0.6178566813,-0.3083430529,0.9964902401,-0.6905457377,0.8057910204,0.1421441585,0.1005922556,1.2879582644,0.4857926965,-0.5805975795,-1.0561203957,0.212733075,-0.7583802342,1.2904171944,-0.408875823,0.8639304638,-0.3342019916,0.981787324,-1.734418869,-0.8289749622,-0.6396710873,-1.002374649,-1.398937583]},{"index":416,"text":"no,

government to enforce our immigration laws, and we will not be able to do anything on immigration until we first prove to the american people that illegal immigration is under control. and we can do that. we know what it takes to do that. it takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. it takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. it takes a mandatory e-verify system and a mandatory entry\/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. after we have done that, the second thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal immigration system. and after we have done those two things, i think the american people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn't otherwise violated our laws -- because if they're a criminal they can't stay. they'll have to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. and ultimately, they'll given a work permit and that's all they're gonna be allowed to have for at least 10 years. but you can't get to that third step until you have done the other two things, and that was the lesson we learned in 2013. there is no trust that the federal government will enforce the law. they will not support you until you see it done

was an eternal optimist in the american people. and i am too. so here's what i think will make america better. we need to live in a world where our children are free, are free from the threats of radical islamic terrorism. we need to live in an america where we have an economy, where everyone can live their piece of the american dream, no matter what that dream is. and we need to live in an america where we have a federal government that is not too big to fail, but ultimately small enough to succeed, where we send powers back to the states and back to the people. that's what i did in wisconsin. we took on the big government union bosses, the big government special interests, many of whom came in from washington, to spend millions of dollars to try and take me out because we stood

artificially. those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place. and i think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation. this country was -- declared its independence in 1776. in less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. and the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. those are the fuels that drive it. and what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. if we can get that out, it makes a big difference. and even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. and it's shifted to the individual. so -- and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich. they go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it. and the middle class, when

with respect to syria, i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made. the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria. the agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to. you know, the russians wanted to buy time. are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. but i would add this. you know, the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution. at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together. this is incredibly complicated, because we've got iran as a big player, in addition to russia. we have saudi arabia, turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. this is one of the areas i've disagreed with senator sanders on, who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria, which i think would be a grave mistake. putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me. trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. so let's support what secretary kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. and remember, the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups. so as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and the like. so we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the russians.","class":0,"tokens":[-3.9561896324,-0.1087977216,0.3396168351,-0.1675589085,1.2303655148,0.1703504026,0.8620637655,0.1497463286,-2.2259917259,-0.354005456,0.4109259248,0.4419536293,2.5690395832,-0.4240454435,-1.0529761314,1.388874054,0.5334784985,-0.6417409182,-3.6333014965,0.099836804,2.1055355072,-1.3559961319,-2.0048193932,0.1257531047,1.0499813557,-0.6538351774,0.0701134726,-0.65936625,-0.7003052235,2.2223002911,-0.0560870096,-1.0666613579,-1.3599137068,-0.3876855671,0.8162852526,-0.867459774,-1.1952706575,-1.4328796864,-0.5674744844,0.1716537923,0.0773925036,1.0399872065,-0.4489512444,0.6834821105,-0.3415368199,1.1096361876,1.7379386425,-2.3145132065,2.4737648964,-0.9745678902,3.0743882656,-0.3548719883,-0.7686136365,-0.7138124704,-0.2933562994,1.2705948353,-0.199308455,-1.1943877935,-1.0242956877,-1.7067904472,-1.3095244169,1.1767464876,0.0037216907,-0.025015099,-0.6648997068,-0.6030634046,0.3590083718,-1.1020553112,-1.5487543344,0.6393322349,-4.4882946014,-0.0909096003,1.7166092396,1.1660085917,-1.1183942556,0.1807914078,0.6223634481,-1.3286749125,1.8371605873,1.3636646271,-3.3651640415,1.4987117052,1.0908761024,1.6496292353,-0.5433815122,0.994114995,2.128991127,0.6752975583,1.6387245655,-0.132417053,0.2594564855,1.8893802166,1.9029115438,0.0942335501,0.39160797,0.4719971716,0.8435814381,-0.1534598023,-0.2985215783,-0.47231251]},{"index":483,"text":"i

i have been several times in your services and have joined in those prayers and have also been privileged to lead them in some settings. i pray very specifically for people whom i know by name. people who either have gone through or are experiencing difficult times, illness, divorce, death, disappointment, all of the life experiences that confront most of us. i pray for the will of god to be known that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it. i have said many times that, you know, i am a praying person, and if i haven't been during the time i was in the white house, i would have become one. because it's very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith. so i do pray for people in authority. i try to think about what they are going through, even when i disagree with them. trying to find some common ground, some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic. i don't always succeed. i will tell you that. so i pray on a pretty regular basis during the day, because i need that strength and i need that support. and especially when you are in the position that i'm in and that senator sanders is in, where you are asking people to vote for you, to give you the most important job, not only in our country, but i would argue in the world. i think humility is one

me go answer mr. mcghee's question because i think it's a profound one. i think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when i was a teenager,

of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear dr. king speak in chicago when i was about 14 years old. that got me thinking about what i needed to do to try to fulfill my faith. when i was in law school, i had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named mary right adelman, who worked with dr. king who was the first african-american woman who passed the mississippi bar. i asked her for a job and she said she didn't have any money. i was working my way through law school and she said if i could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. so i got law students a civil rights research council grant. the first thing she did was send me to look at south carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. the second thing she did was to send me to alabama to investigate segregated academies. so from that moment until today, i am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the children's defense fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything i can to address systemic

structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. they are hiring a consulting company like tata, for example, out of india. that company then hoards up all of these visas. they hire workers. you hire -- disney or some other company hires this company. what they're basically doing is they are insourcing and

business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it. it is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace americans. and if a company is caught doing that, whether it be disney or anyone else, they should be

coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal. you know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights

communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country. i particularly appreciate the proposal that congressman jim clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. and you know what? if you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out. so, yes, i do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is. and

why they no longer trust this president and are willing to work alongside them. but they have as much invested in this as we do. in fact, more so, for it is the king of saudi arabia they want to

is one of the main reasons why isis even exists to begin with. assad is a puppet of iran. and he has been so brutal toward the sunni within syria that he created the space that led to the people of syria themselves to stand up and try to overthrow him. that led to the chaos which allowed isis to come in and take advantage of that situation and grow more powerful. and the fact that this president led from behind meant there were no alternative groups on the ground to be empowered, leaving isis with the prime operating space they needed to become the force they have now

not at all. i think that what we're facing with isis is especially complicated. it was a different situation in afghanistan. we were attacked from afghanistan. al qaida was based in afghanistan. we went after those who had attacked us. what's happening in syria and iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in baghdad, led by maliki, there has been a resurgence of sunni activities, as exemplified by isis. and we have to support sunni-arab and kurdish forces against isis, because i believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the united states to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what isis wants. they've advertised that. they want american troops back in the middle east. they want american soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity. so, i think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of american troops into syria and iraq to fight isis. and we do have to form a coalition. i know how hard that is. i have formed them. i put together a coalition, including arabs, with respect to libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto iran. and you have to really work hard at it. and the final thing i would say, bringing donald trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of isis you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the

exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of florida, and all over the country. they're coming to the mainland from puerto rico because the economy there is not growing, it's too expensive to do business there. the tax rate is too high. the government regulations are too extensive. this year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next. so, i think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again. if the economy of puerto rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments. so, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland. they're united states

with. we need to repeal obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts americans in charge of their health care money again. if your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in america they want to buy it from. otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country. and if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. and that, i think, is a much better approach than obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy. it is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's

the rich kids who use drugs aren't. i personally think that this is a crime for which the only victim is the individual, and i think that america has to take a different attitude. i would like to see more rehabilitation and less incarceration. i'm a fan of the drug courts which try to direct you back towards work and less time in jail. but the bottom line is the states. we say we like the 10th amendment, until we start talking about this. and i think the federal government has gone too far, i think that the war on drugs has had a racial outcome, and really has been something that has really damaged our inner cities. not only do the drugs damage them, we damage them again by incarcerating them and then preventing them from getting employment over time. so i don't think that the federal government should override the states. i believe in the 10th amendment and i really will say that the states are left to

very, very difficult and painful way for us as a people. look, the truth of the matter is that we should all feel a sense of responsibility as americans to look for the things that actually work to save and redeem lives, and to do more of them, and to stop doing the things that don't. for my part, that's what i have done in 15 years of experience as a mayor and as a governor. we restored voting rights to 52,000 people. we decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana. i repealed the death penalty. and we also put in place a civilian review board. we reported openly discourtesy, and lethal force and brutality complaints. this is something that -- and i put forward a new agenda for criminal justice reform that is informed by that experience. so as president, i would lead these efforts, and i would do so with more experience and probably the attendance at more grave sites than any of the three of us on this stage when it comes to urban crime, loss of lives. and the truth is

support our partners in nato, and we have to send a very clear message to putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. the best way to do

marriage and wrongfully tear down the marriage laws of all 50 states. now, interconnected to this is the question of religious liberty. and at the last debate, one of my colleagues on this stage said on the question of religious liberty and supreme court nominees that he'd be willing to compromise and negotiate. i can tell you, for me, there are areas that we should compromise on. marginal tax

compromise away your religious liberty. and for me, bret, religious liberty has been a lifelong passion. i've spent two decades defending religious liberty, including defending the ten commandments

i have what i call the new college compact. because i think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know. number one, states have been dis-investing in higher education. in fact, i think new hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country. so states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education. so under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system. secondly, i don't believe in free tuition for everybody. i believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead. so i have proposed debt free tuition, which i think is affordable and i would move a lot of the pell grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense. so i put all of this together, again, on my website and i've gotten such a good response. but i want to quickly say, one of the areas that senator sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems. free college, a single payer system for health--and it's been estimated we're looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget. and i have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run. and i think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that i have proposed i will tell you exactly how i'm going to pay for it; including college.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.4851239324,-0.6114298105,-1.2241340876,-2.4036982059,0.6577399373,2.3301517963,-0.7112857103,0.8831045032,-0.1876020283,-0.2069974989,-1.5061739683,0.0027621093,-0.6129721999,0.2884196341,0.7086180449,-1.2233382463,-0.8995752931,1.2699940205,-0.2903247178,1.0588148832,-2.5010564327,-0.6940512061,-0.5554056168,-0.608479023,-2.2773134708,-1.062871933,-0.7493885159,-0.1448301077,-2.8387892246,1.3988951445,0.9430252314,-1.7287373543,1.1105175018,-1.0714105368,-0.4388746917,-1.0803592205,0.7979570031,-0.6775577664,1.2647641897,0.6725434065,-2.1985082626,-0.8173457384,-0.53096807,0.6529247165,0.2142120451,0.1524287164,-0.5633457303,1.0659214258,0.8184995651,-0.1598476022,-1.3369008303,0.9604525566,-0.624974966,0.5697655678,-0.5263123512,0.3028206527,-1.5638064146,-0.3525079787,-1.1816034317,-0.0731480643,-1.7511662245,-0.5378733873,-0.6287114024,-2.7795026302,0.0700166002,3.0028071404,0.2086273581,-0.8366425037,-1.0518535376,2.2138957977,-1.9419516325,-1.2553527355,1.3363506794,-1.3764675856,1.2172706127,-0.1176783741,-0.1914597601,-1.7879756689,-0.7349339724,1.0502325296,-1.7513341904,0.4068850875,-0.1862142086,0.8070060611,1.0197297335,-1.6282670498,-1.137473464,0.3009463251,-2.4966216087,-0.5552169085,0.9707639813,0.8042348027,-1.6743578911,-0.0240920652,0.2576978803,0.5867297649,1.57756567,1.4719723463,-0.5670817494,-1.273658514]},{"index":846,"text":"that's

a governor. as mayor, i brought labor peace to my city and kept taxes down. i was reelected three times. as a senator, i earned a reputation for courageous votes against the bush-cheney tax cuts the favored the wealthy, against the tragedy of the iraq war, for environmental stewardship, for protection of our civil liberties. i served on the foreign relations committee and i chaired the middle east subcommittee for four years. as governor, i came in at the depths of the recession and we turned my state around. rhode island had the biggest drop of the unemployment rate over my four budgets of all but one state. it happens to be nevada, where we're having this debate. i'm very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, i have had no scandals. i've always been honest. i have the courage to take the long-term view, and i've shown good judgment. i have high ethical standards. as we look to the future, i want to address the income inequality, close the gap between the haves

anybody hears their pains or their concerns. young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon. it ain't going to happen. low income people who are not

states government engaging in massive surveillance on american citizens, that was a very troubling development, and it's why the united states congress acted to correct it. now, at the same time, i said in that initial statement that if the evidence indicated that edward snowden violated the law, he should be prosecuted for violating the law. and, indeed, since then, the evidence is clear that not only does snowden violate the law, but it appears he committed treason. treason is defined under the constitution as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of america, and what snowden did made it easier for terrorists to avoid detection. and snowden's comments afterwards, and his behavior afterwards, he fled to russia, he fled to china. his conducts afterwards indicates that he was not a whistleblower, but instead he was undermining the ability to defend this country. but we need a president who isn't rash, who doesn't just pop off at the -- at the hip, but waits to see what the facts

thing i said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms. for example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days. you also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor. but here's the best solution of all. we need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century. why, for the life of me, i do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in america, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work. but the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so americans have the skills for those jobs. but in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers to canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here. but the ideal scenario is to train americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from

movement.","class":1,"tokens":[0.0021106836,0.159363091,-0.3974917233,-0.036732737,-0.2818730474,0.1465804577,-0.0479609817,-0.0739561915,-0.6556376815,-0.2634684443,0.2180110812,-0.3337310851,0.2956823707,0.6799117923,-0.3934480846,-0.2131919563,0.7291439176,0.8268592358,0.4394685626,-1.4606362581,-0.3839040995,-0.628485322,-0.3228912652,-0.1919802427,-0.5003782511,-0.6592946053,-1.0789122581,0.3122491539,0.624152422,-0.260733515,-0.469502002,0.3763909042,-0.7916743755,-0.8200103641,0.2356997132,0.2462285459,-1.0686768293,-0.0021768678,0.543702364,0.0383643433,-0.9579459429,0.1343776137,0.1783974916,0.8921685219,-0.2894546986,-0.2999209464,0.088720575,-0.6167963743,0.923124373,0.0610235184,0.0213703811,0.9830746055,0.4806220233,0.5438585281,-0.0596171655,-0.0957249701,-0.4240752757,-0.4513807297,0.2233379483,-0.6022298336,0.3288294375,-0.0506897345,0.6905882359,1.0487471819,-0.1398312449,-0.7589107752,-0.3097722828,-0.0443441272,0.0934861004,0.5112239122,-0.8885667324,0.9085036516,-0.8645424843,-1.5604618788,0.7661119699,-0.3105320036,-0.1968947947,-0.7365018129,-0.6545639634,-0.3354074359,-0.2771139145,1.3207877874,-0.8097285628,0.2185569704,0.3907113373,-0.9400555491,-0.1907526851,-0.6307826638,-0.2989435792,0.7555144429,-0.4926978946,-0.2570634782,-0.8982845545,0.0085125603,0.7668828368,0.1180965602,0.367731899,0.1683305651,0.0986331329,-0.7744098902]},{"index":977,"text":"i

systemic racism that we have to root out in our society. i think president obama has set a great example. i think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward. now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next. we now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system. we now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. i think what president obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first african american president,

be clear, what i said the other day was that we need to lift the political restrictions that are already in play. barack obama's administration has put political restrictions on the military personnel

certainly shouldn't have a commander-in-chief who sends a message to our adversaries as to how far we're going to go, and how far we're willing to fight, so i'm not putting a troop number. what i'm saying is lift the political restrictions. when you do that, you empower our military personnel already there to work with the kurd and the sunni allies, to reclaim the territory taken by isis. and to do so in a way that allows that isis doesn't go back in syria, as we were just talking about here. that is the fundamental problem going forward. we have a president -- and hillary clinton was a part

thank you, and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the democratic debates. i'm hillary clinton. i have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady, as a senator from new york, and as secretary of state. i'm the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child. and every day, i think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her, but for all of our children. i have spent a very long time -- my entire adult life -- looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her god-given potential. i've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and i've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. at the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them. and then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one. right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. so i have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families. and i want to do more to help us balance family and work. i believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but i also believe it's about time we had paid family leave for american families and join the rest of the world.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.1000639871,-0.2440675795,0.5696637034,-0.0726709887,-0.3023712933,1.176861763,0.2191645354,-0.7946900725,-2.0157239437,1.5335431099,1.1645979881,0.2403242439,-1.1211028099,2.31254673,2.0693860054,-1.6334645748,-0.1656221598,0.796254158,-0.1016721949,0.0270332731,-0.9459909797,-1.5449966192,-0.7249465585,-0.7891643643,0.5051475763,-0.5513173938,0.5679630637,2.0234057903,-0.172863856,-0.1382994652,1.1470726728,0.4080637693,-0.6173107624,-2.4578773975,-0.8976986408,1.2613811493,1.3279227018,0.2708738148,1.7274816036,-0.5036904216,-1.86389184,-0.4509181976,-1.1370477676,-0.675062418,-0.9831792116,1.7519284487,-0.8675690293,0.513027966,0.51457268,0.173097387,-0.9840798974,0.3428686261,1.8613625765,0.2523038685,-0.8466565013,0.9235571027,-0.0771800652,1.2840272188,0.3794853687,1.1507710218,-0.3038090765,-1.7035825253,1.2614108324,-1.0243970156,0.3657047749,1.1532845497,0.3394397199,0.672324419,-0.2741431296,0.9687383175,-1.9432140589,0.0940098315,0.029702628,-0.5534697771,0.3040774465,0.2696047723,-1.2344623804,0.8983719349,-0.4350772202,1.7236526012,-0.9399142265,2.0944330692,-0.1329661459,0.0691608638,0.1477421075,-0.6817689538,1.3115400076,1.3213917017,-1.6755206585,-0.2848559022,0.280311048,-0.2585597336,-1.1628390551,1.62089324,0.4276612699,-0.3868961036,1.8100870848,2.0325319767,1.3069556952,1.3073773384]},{"index":1068,"text":"i

water.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.5645677447,0.4404036701,-0.326689899,0.295353502,0.2764256597,0.217971161,-0.1851119399,-0.4551668465,-1.0689618587,0.7914540768,0.6399778724,0.9771071076,-0.170262605,0.8013671637,-0.4926116168,-0.6509705186,0.8094742298,-0.1494008899,-0.2628874183,-0.2022715211,-0.8753051758,0.3418680429,-0.2465298921,-0.7583750486,-0.1452983916,0.2037596107,-0.8519179821,-0.1742930263,0.6834267378,-0.7705082297,-0.0218903068,0.1056895107,-0.363052994,-0.5952718258,-0.4663910568,0.0505563579,0.9864037633,-0.0699621439,0.8929526806,0.8349585533,-0.514626503,-0.6779466867,-0.8367609382,-0.4569910765,0.0304101482,-0.1392175555,-0.054078877,-0.4162058532,1.2196029425,-0.6919434667,-0.164933458,0.7247843146,-0.3702379167,0.3553986251,0.6461587548,-0.0470236838,-0.3116410673,0.8123601675,1.0152323246,-1.0693688393,0.4509379864,-0.7768387794,1.6681466103,0.4645873904,-0.5642960668,0.8785237074,0.4545504749,-0.4542140961,0.0459006242,-0.7757430673,-1.3594424725,0.4553873837,0.7006137967,0.3433094621,0.2632313669,-0.4020650685,1.0330672264,0.4729342163,0.6987965703,0.7281912565,-0.6363680363,-0.0461522862,-0.1109507829,0.1434268206,0.4152887762,-0.0553248264,-1.1246250868,-0.2310334593,-0.4604066312,0.1793162525,-0.6201398373,0.4795075655,0.2467625439,0.2756575346,-0.4485972524,0.2751826346,-0.594373107,0.5418998599,0.1988226473,-0.3063670099]},{"index":1081,"text":"yeah,

you can, because african-americans and latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. so, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. but it is a general economic issue. and here's what the economic issue is. the wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. why is that? because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate america through nafta and permanent normal trade relations with china, secretary clinton and i disagree on those issues. but view is those trade policies have enabled corporate america to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. but you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits. you once had a pension. those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. they're off to china. now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone. what have you got now? you are working at mcdonald's? that is why there is massive despair all over this country. people have worked their entire lives. they're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all. and that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down. suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.4042362571,1.1615928411,1.8006218672,0.8383953571,-0.0297535826,0.4198577404,-0.3528014421,0.6259976625,-2.3398826122,2.0293960571,-0.367397666,-0.3286499381,-0.0765244067,-0.1592975408,2.2366502285,0.3014874756,-2.5111219883,-0.9370356202,-1.0554230213,-0.6565055847,0.1862978339,0.3617824316,-0.5968977213,-0.9535267949,-1.5871506929,-0.3739638031,0.6451122165,0.173550725,-0.4576176405,-2.4362602234,0.5364287496,0.1011934504,0.0215804018,-0.5898739696,-1.1458784342,0.8929447532,0.1028815284,0.0914106146,-2.1636581421,-0.8989673257,-0.2751822174,-1.3359230757,1.3368303776,0.6393800378,0.9650325775,1.2525455952,0.0385164991,1.133544445,0.1914976537,-1.982535243,0.501506865,2.5873711109,-1.3732284307,-0.3833110631,-1.3882967234,1.1108596325,0.3480015099,1.9389747381,0.5642032027,1.3158932924,0.4691207111,-0.1535321474,1.90155375,0.2268805653,1.8244235516,0.8523815274,-0.6627981067,-0.9033184052,-0.1753027141,1.3677386045,-0.1816797256,1.0402332544,0.1668318063,0.7290070653,0.1059258431,1.8008959293,-2.1779501438,-1.4114481211,-0.3858095407,-2.1048288345,0.1856749356,0.5922644138,-1.2275286913,-1.1232335567,0.784098804,0.4357315302,-1.310111165,-2.0868692398,0.0016925647,-0.7858520746,-1.0406062603,-0.4036929905,-0.9919404984,0.3307048976,1.6133354902,-0.0630314276,-0.6880741119,1.1658096313,-0.2455158383,-1.4664151669]},{"index":1102,"text":"well,

states.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.2650448978,0.3000713289,-0.3885055184,-0.6340440512,0.3061538339,-0.8917375207,-0.2805739343,-0.5544890165,-0.6759313345,-0.7783957124,0.2203061581,0.2899335921,-0.0488074794,0.6160696149,0.3044365644,0.0835638046,-0.1061137021,-0.6146273017,-0.8166611791,-0.3659353852,-0.1578388363,-0.5194969773,0.3280798197,-0.3638522327,-0.0045493725,-0.0794476718,-1.428127408,0.2721253932,1.0830152035,0.0572463088,0.2814148068,-0.0515757725,-1.5129047632,-0.6613499522,-0.9501790404,0.7643372416,0.2349647135,0.1991313547,1.0501072407,-0.4455414116,-0.1816551983,-0.9045125842,-0.3274624646,-0.6129754782,-0.2842539251,0.8873618841,0.3716548681,-0.0193254687,1.0910646915,0.8052635789,0.7334055901,0.797023654,0.5118019581,0.8304806352,0.2409749478,0.5125407577,0.1973403841,0.025817696,-1.7071280479,-1.3131090403,-1.0210790634,-0.8964846134,0.6791516542,0.3777931631,0.9691198468,0.305650413,0.3690271378,0.5616004467,-0.558149755,0.2832244933,-1.2514089346,-0.2228920758,-0.2217053175,-0.3825417459,-0.3062339127,-0.114252679,0.7377491593,-0.06193709,0.8645499945,-0.2795780897,-0.1453783661,1.8781943321,-0.2239941657,0.34261778,0.1625858694,0.8803058863,-0.5735571384,0.4657779038,-0.1427143216,-0.1679546833,-0.9005567431,0.1752853692,0.5247906446,-0.0595227629,0.676068604,-0.1522556543,0.9461673498,1.3646272421,1.1652685404,-1.2253792286]},{"index":1111,"text":"listen,

the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in new york come from out of state. they come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in

made a commitment to the nra that he would be against waiting periods. and, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here's what he said. he clearly was helped by the nra, because they ran ads against his opponent. so, then he went to the congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the nra. voting -- he kept his word to the nra, he voted against the brady bill five times because it had waiting periods in it. thankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have

federal reserve has made this problem worse. by artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money. they're actually talking now about negative interest. the money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in new york. and because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. so what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality. we also find that as the federal reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst. so really we need to reexamine whether we not -- we want a federal reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates. we also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse. but the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a city with a republican mayor or a state with a republican governor.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.1247674078,-0.8153120279,0.4750502408,-0.9410588741,0.0818473101,2.166223526,-0.4833569825,0.3578262925,-1.6651080847,1.9854282141,2.141651392,-1.2744091749,-0.2292246372,0.6958665848,0.1099856347,-1.1242002249,0.3679030836,-0.4271333814,-2.887595892,-1.4981105328,-0.5746097565,1.5248411894,-1.835288167,0.7354196906,0.753415525,-0.9668161273,1.2790566683,-0.0632252544,-0.4869582951,-0.7920555472,0.6846188307,0.6330630779,1.6362398863,-1.902536273,-0.695884347,-0.1096120924,-0.1003080606,-1.2844702005,0.2219802886,-0.383452177,0.1450618356,-1.4400759935,0.1749501228,-0.9618386626,-0.4122536778,1.8159487247,1.1264734268,2.2164957523,0.0707088783,0.4868871272,-0.3102986217,1.0873118639,0.1977560818,-0.0140868342,-0.5060819983,-1.6902481318,-1.0190912485,-0.4240102172,0.635609746,1.9753494263,-1.131967783,-0.114822939,0.9365840554,0.2675989568,-0.7360117435,0.5255951285,-0.0687275529,-1.6978939772,0.5312327743,2.1959211826,-1.3211185932,-0.9522420764,0.232029289,1.0915747881,1.1021142006,0.6497067213,-0.0395463854,-1.0170577765,1.0919840336,-0.3980639279,1.4448596239,0.9882234335,2.8488042355,-1.1922932863,-0.623778224,0.4442314506,-0.3022810817,-0.7629329562,-0.2396211624,-0.2253487706,0.3567660153,1.3630392551,0.0213405881,-2.1854977608,2.0426282883,0.0637355894,-1.569221139,0.6470881701,1.290897131,0.1293257028]},{"index":1140,"text":"i

strengthened the tools of national security and law enforcement to go after terrorists. it gave us greater tools and we are seeing those tools work right now in san bernardino. and in particular, what it did is the prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. when you had a terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily land lines. the usa

first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop gadhafi from committing massacres against his people. the united states was asked to support the europeans and the arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, i recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of gadhafi. i think that what libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path. now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the arab spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that isis and other terrorist groups do. but what we're seeing happening in libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among libyans themselves to try to dislodge isis from sirte, the home town of gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government. you know, this is not easy work. we did a lot to help. we did as much as we could because the libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept. but we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.5220779777,-0.2819826305,-2.256778717,0.5438343883,0.3148224652,1.8569927216,-0.0345216766,-0.7528768778,-0.0055913972,1.7246124744,-0.5132457614,0.2240729034,0.1266924292,-0.3050626516,-0.5776667595,1.0312817097,-0.2753588259,1.1094148159,-0.4580571949,-0.1519805938,2.018805027,-1.8783380985,-0.7802952528,0.2696374357,1.1758183241,0.3656398058,0.4040968418,-1.7334376574,0.8346753716,1.0093630552,0.6535586119,-0.7142296433,-0.7162691951,-1.3189789057,0.7836501598,-2.8524928093,0.8782964945,-0.931473434,0.2832740545,-0.5326290727,0.2974368334,1.9990280867,-0.4540689588,0.8001577854,-0.8150371313,0.7804464698,0.4441491961,-0.344448179,-0.101947397,-1.2172164917,1.9973533154,-0.0381797962,-0.3524088562,-0.6300267577,-1.2393736839,1.0822690725,-0.422765106,-1.1514765024,0.3335446715,0.9504072666,0.838817358,0.5771560669,-0.2672711015,-0.7035644054,0.1225236058,0.334100157,-0.1405311972,-0.4936210215,-0.9971306324,0.1627958864,-2.1757624149,-0.2836717367,-0.0635172725,-0.176453799,-0.7295895219,0.0520940199,0.6305730343,0.0100977561,2.5415902138,-0.5971493125,-1.2491161823,2.3657741547,0.174824819,-0.4624592662,-1.5669045448,-0.6767309308,0.1547919512,1.2104514837,-0.3859541714,-0.9316829443,-0.8941899538,-0.4296370447,1.1953041553,1.4059383869,0.5292754173,1.0459597111,0.1187925935,0.2101139426,0.4057607651,0.576843679]},{"index":1182,"text":"well,

you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. but let me just say this. in terms of where we are right now, as you mention, rachel, in a number of national and state, including new hampshire. for example, the last poll i saw -- there may have been a new one -- last one i saw here in new hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. there were also pretty large margins in iowa and wisconsin. these are polls. polls go up. polls go down. but here's why i think i will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process. republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. i believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout. if there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the white house, but i think we regain the senate. we win governors' chairs up and down the line. so i believe if you want to retain the white house, if you want to see democrats

david, i think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country. we have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended. i feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect. trust has been totally lost in a lot of places. at the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically. the young officer who was killed responding to the planned parenthood murders. the officer who told the victims of the san bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them. so i think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that president obama impaneled. we need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this. and we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.1297739744,-0.8276483417,-2.303324461,-0.2536199689,0.0064284122,2.0373558998,0.6395463943,0.3938862383,-1.4995507002,0.8533109426,0.2526523173,0.6735895872,0.5732178092,0.6635220051,0.5005243421,-0.1189983711,-0.8223315477,0.312274158,-0.0831023827,-0.1076350883,0.8553824425,-1.2766809464,2.2729556561,1.3564380407,2.1494543552,0.623301208,-0.3602628708,-0.3355339766,0.6538167,0.5268794894,1.1853482723,0.9126184583,-0.8299657702,-2.1821672916,-0.6402873993,0.0123414742,0.7580945492,0.2364866734,-0.3732433617,-0.2789265215,0.220120579,-1.0969320536,-1.5717356205,-1.8085591793,0.773204565,0.2308564186,0.230031088,0.0844298974,0.3080656528,-1.6435945034,-0.3479378223,0.010650822,0.2448895127,-0.3072096407,-0.6958227158,-0.2548752725,0.4070366025,-0.8389317989,0.4835180044,-1.6730834246,0.4960612953,0.1899247169,0.3900135458,0.3056472838,-0.5859556794,1.1689510345,1.264134407,0.4324104786,-1.7048879862,0.5659955144,-0.9892778397,-0.2695555389,-0.1283816397,0.4750511944,-0.0654238835,-0.4018035829,2.043533802,0.7735152841,-0.7584421039,0.2507597208,-0.1969783306,0.9401195645,-0.3291942477,0.150865525,0.2477985919,-0.2657572329,-1.0101636648,0.555541873,-0.5090858936,-0.1549996883,-0.9693033695,0.7048073411,0.7685880661,-1.078864336,-1.0999279022,-0.4224264622,0.9348996878,-0.2187886238,-0.6884109378,0.0148419784]},{"index":1292,"text":"there

depend on that social security, they'll get their full benefit. that's the way it will work. and we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age. and how do i know that? i've done all this

look, i believe that we've made great progress as a country with the affordable care act. we've been struggling to get this done since harry truman. and it was not only a great accomplishment of the democratic party, but of president obama. i do think that it's important to defend it. the republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times. they would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now. i want to build on and improve the affordable care act. i would certainly tackle the cost issues, because i think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down. but i think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that i have with senator sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone. and it's-- it's a worthy debate. it's an important one that we should be engaged in.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.8846541643,-2.1849603653,-1.2962024212,0.7071965337,-0.8180740476,0.9844585061,-0.9087934494,-1.0117083788,-0.7829403281,0.442785114,-1.2062300444,-0.2976826429,-1.0704677105,1.1629149914,-0.6893855929,-2.0742866993,-0.3129510283,1.3931554556,0.7518395185,1.5306031704,-0.7514716983,-0.562125504,0.3177356124,0.3888293207,1.0510289669,-0.248759672,-0.1174991429,0.9189481139,-1.5867336988,-0.5655885935,1.3737910986,-0.1562004089,0.8295365572,0.4086645842,0.3964205682,-0.2854423821,1.201281786,-0.0461057387,-0.9793772697,-0.29630512,0.6506530046,0.3909306228,-0.499885112,-0.3940241337,-0.0174826868,1.5674550533,-0.1067283824,-1.1920433044,0.2944678664,-0.4537860453,0.1322845221,-0.2658373117,1.0304723978,-0.513279736,-1.2116663456,-0.3577387333,1.0391081572,0.9995293617,-0.5160373449,-0.7958852053,0.3923445642,-0.0785365552,0.0024976507,-0.3422984779,0.8324757814,0.75087291,0.1099861711,-1.7900396585,-0.8703323603,2.0930345058,-0.8645001054,-0.1278732568,-0.6146759987,0.7936372161,-1.3709431887,-0.4996396601,-0.3369777501,-0.0142547898,0.5051739812,2.3449313641,0.1073442101,2.3263039589,-0.3568190336,-0.8119952679,1.0871758461,-0.378757,0.4416012466,0.6303570271,-0.7120156288,-1.104612112,0.2222135216,0.421829015,-0.9076496959,-0.2892047167,0.8603817225,-0.8272550702,0.2569482327,0.8074028492,-0.3255623281,-0.4079996645]},{"index":1330,"text":"...here

know, i completely agree with senator sanders. the first speech i gave in this campaign back in april was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration. the statistics from wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for african-americans in our nation, twice the national average. and we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of dontre hamilton right here in milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us. his family certainly believes that. and so do i. so we have work to do. there have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. president obama's policing commission came out with some. i have fully endorsed those. but we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect. and, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level. but, i would also add this. there are other racial discrepancies. really systemic racism in this state, as

someone who wasn't interested in fixing america. we elected someone as president who wants to change america, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world. and so he undermines the constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military. and that's why 2016 is a turning point in our

easy to talk about the problems. but do you have a solution to fix it? and i think the solution is several things. number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting american workers first, not the corporate board room. number two, we need to lift the regulations on american businesses here so we see jobs coming back. and number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan i've introduced

i'm glad you asked that, maria. here's -- here's our plan. we've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform. if you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know. and what that's led to over $2 trillion of american companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. and who can blame them? they pay tax once overseas. they don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back. so beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money. bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the united states. we'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. and i would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country. it would not necessitate us raising any taxes. it would bring the money back into the united states to help build jobs by american companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. and -- and -- and the last piece of this, maria, is this. you know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in america. he's penalized -- and doesn't understand. in fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers. you've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the obama administration. that's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. we'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively. and remember this -- i'm credible on this for this reason: americans for tax reform says that i've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in american history. we don't need to raise taxes to get this done. we need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the united states to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists. all of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a christie administration.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.801363647,0.6865819097,-0.8279196024,-0.1613423079,-1.1870179176,-0.7440517545,-1.6177480221,-0.8168750405,-3.4120335579,-0.1196939051,-0.1813782454,-0.0006650647,-1.2886537313,-1.9081952572,-1.4252693653,-2.8157534599,-1.6966925859,0.5549322963,2.0984382629,-0.3607709408,-0.7875321507,0.6995662451,-0.7158945203,-3.6350107193,-2.4677548409,0.5080952048,-2.2294723988,1.4859877825,0.3718459606,-0.5100114942,1.3832169771,0.934425056,-1.2144927979,-0.7020611763,0.1102703884,0.2094591558,0.5091171861,0.1167168245,-0.5705177188,-0.4483892918,-1.8104270697,-0.8407722712,-0.1366846561,1.7442040443,1.7104530334,3.6920721531,1.7004569769,-0.3999313116,1.143530488,0.6504796743,-1.2898982763,0.4069029093,-0.5300802588,0.4326037169,-0.6784927845,-0.3389859498,-0.8870992064,-2.2735433578,-0.6275556684,0.5366933942,-0.2190216333,0.2801758051,0.9851868153,1.5192859173,-0.9332811236,1.140598774,-0.7331854105,-0.0259955935,-2.0507640839,0.246589601,-0.6997611523,-0.6882715225,-0.821583271,1.7196813822,2.2145924568,-1.5711764097,-0.3985632956,-1.7138388157,0.5939132571,-0.9171299338,2.1483547688,2.13956213,0.5681856275,0.0873172134,-1.4330843687,1.2578210831,0.5040516853,1.2359474897,1.1771343946,1.0400656462,-0.1356453001,-0.0746441782,-1.2489329576,1.0059938431,-0.1342910975,-1.2493420839,1.7796686888,-2.7823059559,1.0107740164,0.4916859567]},{"index":1593,"text":"what

exercise.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.01230177,-0.5978150368,0.0412889533,-0.17978324,0.5016168952,-0.8565322161,0.2713600993,-1.1349147558,-0.5355497003,-0.4233600199,-0.4501317739,0.367973417,-0.2077715248,-0.3054704368,-0.588463068,0.5006807446,0.0100494549,-1.2715113163,-0.5121463537,-0.6876792908,0.2681572735,-0.9640623331,-0.230356425,0.3882233202,0.2447952032,0.7277801633,-0.1890654117,-0.4100147486,0.4382116199,0.4515219033,0.8097829819,-0.6279553771,-0.3593826294,-0.9046065807,-0.5833733678,-1.1796686649,-0.007087897,-0.4544685781,-0.0762774497,0.6549633741,-0.4408873618,-0.7780506611,-0.842887342,-0.0502074398,-1.1356691122,-0.467089951,0.6324589252,-0.4191321135,0.8428417444,-0.8503798246,0.2138935626,0.0361942053,-0.1479038596,0.2185560763,-0.4896310568,0.4871584773,-0.9016853571,1.2213203907,0.5320340395,-0.0816109553,0.8318480253,-0.0863942951,0.5565593839,-0.7358789444,0.2185428739,-0.810079515,-0.1533133686,-0.0115014724,-0.1731746644,0.8084797263,-1.5671117306,0.2556397319,1.0050479174,-0.7330183983,-0.5172751546,0.1909997165,0.2424925715,-0.5549314618,-0.1117419079,0.2534079254,0.1561121196,1.0264523029,-0.7425077558,0.3316205442,0.1976222694,0.3131071031,0.2912223041,-0.9097771645,0.5259383917,-0.3524675667,-0.7737244368,-0.8751779199,-0.1441482306,-0.0478600152,0.7195788622,-0.8916475773,-0.8465966582,0.4727219045,-0.8589730859,-0.397387892]},{"index":1612,"text":"you

have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar. so we have a difference. i also believe in affordable college, but i don't believe in free college, because every expert that i have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs. what i want to do is make sure middle class kids, not donald trump's kids, get to be able to afford college. i want to get the economy going again.

me tell you this, mr. baker, in terms of the cyber attacks, we have the capability to not only have a defensive posture, but it also to make it clear to people that if you attack us with cyber attacks, we will destroy the mechanisms that you are using to attack us. i want to give you a little trip around the world. i served on the defense committee for 18 years. in the ukraine, arm the people there so they can fight for themselves. in the eastern part of europe, make sure that finland and the baltics know that if the russians move, we move. in syria, yes, a no-fly zone in the north on the turkish border, a no-fly zone on the south on the jordanian border. anybody flies in the first time, maybe they can fly out. they fly in there a second time, they will not fly out. and it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be. and it also sends many messages in the middle east that we're still involved. saudi arabia, cut off the funding for the radical clerics, the ones that preach against us. but they're fundamentally our friends. jordan, we want the king to reign for 1,000 years. egypt, they have been our ally and a moderating force in the middle east throughout their history. in the groups -- in the countries of the gulf states of bahrain, the cleveland clinic is opening an operation. clearly we see the same with them. and in israel, we have no better ally in the world, and no more criticizing them in public, we should support them. and finally china, china doesn't own the south china sea, and i give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more. and in the trade agreement, the tpp, it's critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the chinese. they are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend. and finally, i will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics. when the fall comes, and we run against hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected. i have two 16-year-old girls, and i want this country to be strong. we make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble. we must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid. i served in washington as the chairman of the budget committee, and we got the budget balanced. and in ohio, as the ceo, and guess what, we have got to have a ceo mentality and a way to beat hillary clinton and the democracies in the fall. and our ideas have to add up. they have to be solid. and people have to know we have the confidence to lead america. and as president, i will lead this country, as i have before in washington and in ohio, and will return both on domestic and international affairs. and i appreciate the opportunity to speak this time, gerry.","class":1,"tokens":[-1.0542920828,-1.6714459658,-1.3267483711,2.3578794003,0.1063975245,-0.6143685579,0.4329771698,1.0250098705,-0.0546928607,0.1090432554,0.135556221,0.4998960793,1.7679519653,-0.5511093736,-1.7463368177,-1.5093601942,0.3053208292,-0.0285979267,-3.2356007099,0.6798740625,1.1936398745,-0.143698737,-3.6013555527,-0.2617499828,-0.7806173563,0.3767701983,-1.2357270718,1.3815401793,1.2054185867,0.7261922956,0.9121970534,-0.3091826737,-1.6662935019,-1.5594204664,0.6027542353,0.7257933021,-0.3726356626,0.4193968475,-1.4569001198,0.5001074672,-1.5974551439,-0.56879884,-0.3422732949,-0.3523419797,-0.865627408,0.8885217309,0.8912632465,1.5878653526,0.9126439691,-1.549044013,3.2021970749,2.2423467636,-0.1333821416,0.6940826178,0.4684272408,0.4251888096,-0.2096154094,0.2753736079,0.1407791823,1.4510835409,1.7035185099,1.2821955681,0.4017761648,-0.2497387081,0.3714222908,0.8215909004,-0.8686805367,0.7037221789,0.2489629388,2.546841383,0.4945876002,1.9704111814,0.9986667633,-0.6806960106,-0.3731856942,0.6664892435,0.7317808867,-0.2902649641,0.2156130672,1.1048110723,0.8752293587,-0.3491666913,-0.7681383491,1.2263407707,-0.0622532666,-2.1811356544,0.3052306175,0.0244066492,-0.9546974897,-0.735185504,1.8975715637,-1.3110201359,1.9919153452,1.7333695889,-1.9525561333,-1.8917312622,-1.0990095139,-2.628111124,0.5463510752,0.9901082516]},{"index":1653,"text":"well,

slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. first, rather than expand benefits for everyone, i do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. i want to take care of women. when the social security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. and women have been disadvantaged ever since. they do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. and the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their social security monthly payment. so we have no disagreement about the need to buttress social security, get more revenue into the program. but i want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for

not at all. here's the reality of american economic life today. the reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the

corrupt campaign finance system which separates the american people's needs and desires from what congress is doing. so to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution -- contributors. now all of the ideas that i'm talking about, they are not radical ideas. making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the united states. rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the cayman islands and other tax

at the decrease in productivity, look at the way people get used and move on to other drugs when they use marijuana as a gateway drug, it is not them that are the only victims. their families are the

reverse course by creating a strategy of high sustained economic growth, not the new normal of 2 percent that all the left says we just have to get used to, but a 4 percent growth strategy where we reform how we tax, fix the broken regulatory system, embrace the energy revolution in our midst, fix the immigration system so we can turn it into an economic driver, deal with the structural fiscal problems that exist because of our entitlement problems that will overwhelm and create way too much debt. if we grow at 4 percent, people are going to be lifted out of poverty. the great middle that defines our country will have a chance to be able to pursue their dreams as they see fit. that should be the great challenge and the great opportunity for the next president of the united states, to forge consensus to go back to a high-growth strategy. and then we'll be able to lead the world. without a high-growth strategy, our country will never have the resources or the optimism to be able to

of the things that made ronald reagan a great president, is that he understood that america was a unique nation, like any other that had existed throughout human history. he knew it was founded on universal principles that were powerful, the dignity of all people, human rights, the rights of all to live in freedom and liberty, and choose their own path in life. he didn't just believe it, he acted on it. that's why bringing down communism was so important to him. if i'm honored with the opportunity to be president, i hope that our air force one will fly, first and foremost, to our allies; in israel, in south korea, and japan. they know we stand with them. that america can be counted on. it would also fly to china, not just to meet with our enemies, not just to meet with those adversaries of ours that are there, but also to meet with those that aspire to freedom and liberty within china. i would even invite them to my inauguration. we would also fly into moscow and into russia. and not just meet with the leaders of russia, but also meet with those who aspire to freedom and liberty in russia. and ultimately, i hope that my air force one, if i become president, will one day land in a free cuba, where its people can choose its leaders and its own

me -- let me just say this. what a president of the united states has got to do and what is his or her major, i think, responsibility is to, a, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values, that we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity. i voted against the war in iraq because i listened very carefully to what president bush and vice president cheney had to say and i didn't believe them. and if you go to my web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what i feared would happen when i spoke on the floor of the house, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. now i think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where secretary clinton and i disagree is the area of regime change. look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the united states, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. and god only knows saddam hussein was a brutal dictator. we could overthrow assad tomorrow if we wanted to. we got rid of gadhafi. but the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after. and in libya, for example, the united states, secretary clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi. but what happened is a political vacuum developed. isis came in, and now occupies significant territory in libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. but this is nothing new. this has gone on 50 or 60 years where the united states has been involved in overthrowing governments. mossadegh back in 1953. nobody knows who mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of iran. he was overthrown by british and american interests because he threatened oil interests of the british. and as a result of that, the shah of iran came in, terrible dictator. the result of that, you had the iranian revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. unintended consequences. so i believe as president i will look very carefully about unintended consequences. i will do everything i can to make certain that the united states and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the middle east.","class":0,"tokens":[-1.1968274117,-1.0761965513,-0.8110560179,-0.9744820595,-1.0788096189,1.2029180527,0.0804356933,0.3832241893,-0.177400738,-0.9097907543,1.5027403831,-0.5592321157,0.6462554336,0.8945503831,0.9252169132,2.2805423737,0.0568492822,-1.352473259,-1.4463665485,0.8550670147,0.0403829776,-2.6934273243,-0.7902191877,1.0730010271,-0.3210708797,2.0692703724,0.1005201414,-3.2513346672,1.0020599365,-0.4415420592,0.604947567,-2.2902588844,-0.8946543336,-2.2571408749,-0.352943778,-2.0705068111,-0.8159100413,-0.1427447647,0.075440526,-2.1561033726,0.8132247329,-0.0425795652,0.0871223435,2.6146717072,-1.8681828976,-1.5756235123,-0.5615028143,-0.3093799651,0.0489528663,-0.8291481137,2.0663967133,0.275998801,1.1780225039,0.1086014584,-1.4020315409,0.7838459015,0.6498344541,-1.4133136272,0.9780083299,-0.5589357018,1.5526387691,0.7037205696,1.9068758488,0.1639003158,0.9330926538,0.5121332407,-0.9972860217,-0.3099519312,0.4610981941,-0.0555730462,-2.5699195862,-0.6390461922,-0.3971406817,-0.5678509474,1.2300322056,-1.0352615118,0.2038506716,-0.1370840371,-0.5573785901,-0.4604217708,0.6522420645,1.0858873129,-1.7284606695,-0.5679095387,-0.1470188648,-0.6423784494,0.3071208894,-0.1837901473,1.9835635424,-0.738761127,-1.4626131058,-0.5170451403,0.2732103467,-0.5682663321,1.4980840683,1.3267301321,-0.3404769897,1.403275013,-1.009067893,0.6832764745]},{"index":1818,"text":"secretary

first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of america safe. i have a plan that i've put forward to go after isis. not to contain them, but to defeat them. and it has three parts. first, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both syria and iraq. secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism. and thirdly, to do more to keep us safe. under each of those three parts of my plan, i have very specific recommendations about what to do. obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an american-led air campaign, we have to have arab and kurdish troops on the ground. secondly, we've got to go after everything from north africa to south asia and beyond. and then, most importantly, here at home, i think there are three things that we have to get right. we have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information. that now includes the internet, because we have seen that isis is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence. that means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies. they can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists. we've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning. and we must work more closely with muslim-american communities. just like martin, i met with a group of muslim-americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization. they will be

you very much, anderson. and thanks to all the viewers who tuned in tonight. i think what you did see is that, in this debate, we tried to deal with some of the very tough issues facing our country.

improve the lives of the american people? who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done? now, i revere my late mother, and she gave me a lot of good advice. but one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was, you know, the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down. it's whether you get back up. america's been knocked down. that great recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth disappeared. and although we've made progress, we're standing but not running the way america needs to. my mission as president will be to raise incomes for hard-working middle-class families and to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain i was raised with: if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. please join me in this campaign. please come and make it clear that america's best days are still ahead. thank you very

let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they're related. as i've said many times before, my parents were never rich people. my father was a bartender. my mother was a maid. they worked for a living. but they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves. we call that the american dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. it is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people. what makes america special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful. the problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. if i thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, i would be all for it, but it isn't. in the 20th century, it's a disaster. if you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine. and that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated. here's the best way to raise wages. make america the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can
