you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. but let me just say this. in terms of where we are right now, as you mention, rachel, in a number of national and state, including new hampshire. for example, the last poll i saw -- there may have been a new one -- last one i saw here in new hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. there were also pretty large margins in iowa and wisconsin. these are polls. polls go up. polls go down. but here's why i think i will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process. republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. i believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout. if there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the white house, but i think we regain the senate. we win governors' chairs up and down the line. so i believe if you want to retain the white house, if you want to see democrats do well across the board, i think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.","class":0,"tokens":[-1.1820825338,0.2488551289,2.6293690205,0.9097850323,-0.3316687644,2.0037326813,-0.4615657926,-1.8226599693,0.9781053066,-3.7909853458,1.0464390516,0.1510099322,-2.861030817,0.7268233895,0.2315413952,0.5732803345,1.3197627068,-1.360366106,-1.1184927225,2.0587074757,-0.5688295364,0.8177215457,1.7357218266,-0.3401305974,0.9584693909,2.9304308891,0.848425746,-2.7452323437,-0.6940573454,0.4497846067,0.276316911,-0.0667027608,2.7459380627,1.1360651255,-0.5873618722,0.5412219167,2.982180357,1.7314739227,0.9881333113,1.3668960333,1.1222491264,0.9984152913,-1.4000247717,1.7340193987,-1.9822044373,2.0027883053,0.7490419745,-0.1154680997,-1.6214261055,-0.1540888995]},{"index":18,"text":"well,

wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of state. but what i want people to know is i went to wall street before the crash. i was the one saying you're going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. i called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. i proposed changes in ceo compensation. i called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created. and i think the best evidence that the wall street people at least know where i stand and where i have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary. they have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. hedge fund billionaires, karl rove, another billionaire, jumped in. and why are they doing that? these are guys who try to make smart investments. they know my record, they know me, they know that i say what i believe and i will do it. and i also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them. so i do want people to know that, and i think it's important for everybody to understand i have a record, i have stood firm and i will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the

the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in europe, the pressure from russia, which has been incredibly intense. so we did say natural gas is a bridge. we want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can. that's why i've set big goals. i

run by democrats and countries currently run by democrats. so the thing is, let's look for root causes. but i would also say -- lay some blame at the -- the feet of the federal reserve. i think the federal reserve has made this problem worse. by artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money. they're actually talking now about negative interest. the money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in new york. and because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. so what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality. we also find that as the federal reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst. so really we need to reexamine whether we not -- we want a federal reserve that's involved so much

former presidents and he said to bill, \"well i assume hillary has told you about this.\" and bill said, \"no, no, she hasn't.\" there was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.","class":0,"tokens":[1.3754694462,-0.7410954833,-0.3610962927,0.1886500269,-1.8697776794,-0.3298044801,0.4945734441,-0.7352491617,2.046236515,1.7899712324,0.0178335607,1.3869211674,0.7725792527,-1.3998750448,1.7407407761,-0.1327506155,0.1886066049,1.3163983822,0.2946004272,-0.4816683233,1.4950890541,0.4406574368,-0.4532286823,-2.9918866158,0.046262566,2.1781206131,-0.5771840811,-1.0297330618,-0.4270318747,0.3090120554,0.1277464181,-0.4145374298,-1.2236454487,1.3051908016,-2.3287146091,-2.7087452412,-0.0363007709,-0.366122812,0.007631015,-0.2470044494,-0.7482708693,1.2940038443,0.681699276,-1.1826825142,-1.6620371342,-0.0428109616,0.954928875,-1.9169585705,2.7630462646,-1.1173864603]},{"index":284,"text":"i

everybody from birth until death. they can pass it on when they die. we pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. we give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. so dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle. and it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. it

going to do it. now that's just not true. foreign policy is not only consequential, i think much of our future now depends on it. you know, i see a lot of young people at my events around the country.

i agree with president obama who used executive orders to protect families because the congress, the house was unable or refused to act. and in fact i would go further. what would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up. and let me say this also. somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, i disagree with his recent deportation policies. and i would not support those. bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the

heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism. i have strong feelings about that. i thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that timothy mcveigh received the death penalty for blowing up the federal building in oklahoma city, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center. i do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate

know, the simple fact of the matter is, we hear a lot of promises in this debate, a lot of promises about these tax cuts or tax schemes sometimes that i call them. hillary and the democrats promise everything on the spending side. we've got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side. yes, lower taxes, lower spending. my website, johnkasich.com, will show you exactly how we balance the budget. i balanced the budget in washington as a chief architect, and i have balanced it in ohio for one reason. when you balance the budget and you cut taxes, people get work. and our most important moral purpose as leaders in the political system is to make sure we create an environment for job creation so people can live their dreams and realize their god-given potential. that's why it's so important. and for those at the bottom, we've got to do what we can to train them so they can move up. but to just look the other way is not acceptable, because, you know what, as the governor of ohio i have to deal with real challenges, and we've gotten it done in our state, and i will do it for america.","class":1,"tokens":[0.281437546,0.4934884012,0.2630343139,0.3632998765,0.2874055505,0.3494596779,-2.3710741997,-1.4316886663,1.3722547293,-0.9292826056,-2.2060744762,-0.217891261,-3.2557811737,0.8571007848,-0.9156445861,-0.0501215719,0.7911346555,-0.6566704512,-0.8976787925,0.12513192,0.1669086069,0.589507997,0.5621086955,-1.0164940357,-0.5527076125,-1.7692826986,-1.5729527473,0.461186558,-0.2190159261,2.264097929,1.1206299067,0.8008241057,0.7627012134,0.57410568,-1.5500794649,0.298351109,-0.1899616718,-0.4499644339,0.0190788805,0.5313808918,-0.9093414545,-0.5292615891,0.3010515571,0.1017488241,-0.9616167545,-0.6903522611,0.0393530726,-0.9316720366,1.2036560774,0.5119009614]},{"index":516,"text":"...they

brother made a public call to jihad and the obama administration didn't target it. nidal hasan communicated with anwar al-awlaki, a known radical cleric, asked about waging jihad against his fellow

to take pictures at your wedding, and he says, i'd rather not do it, find another photographer, don't sue them in court. you know what, the problem is in our country -- in our country, we need to learn to respect each other and be a little bit more tolerant for one another. and at the end of the day, don't go to court. can't we have common sense in america? that's the way it used to be. and there was a book written called \"the death of common sense.\" we need to bring it back. but at the end of the day, if somebody is being pressured to participate in something that is against their deeply-held religious beliefs, then we're going to have to think about dealing with the law. but you know what, i'd rather people figure this out without having to put another law on the books and

you, anderson. thank you, cnn. and thank you, facebook, for sponsoring this debate. america has many challenges confronting us -- ending the perpetual wars, addressing climate change, addressing income inequality, funding education, funding infrastructure, funding healthcare, helping black americans, helping native americans. we have many challenges. who is best able to confront these challenges? i've served in government at many levels. i know what it's like to solve problems at the local level because i did it as mayor. i know how to get legislation passed through congress because i did it as a senator. i know how to turn around a state because i did as governor of rhode island. but what i'm most proud of is that in 30 years of public service, i have had no scandals. i have high ethical standards. and what i'm most proud of is my judgment, particularly in the iraq war vote. there was a lot of pressure -- political pressure, public pressure. but i did my homework and i did not believe that the evidence was there that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction. and we live now with the consequences. so that kind of judgment is what we want in a president going forward. and i'm running for president to end the wars. i want to be the peacemaker. i am a proven peacemaker. please go to chafee 2016 to learn more about me. thank you.","class":0,"tokens":[1.7855370045,1.6200830936,-0.5623530746,1.2825762033,-1.5736378431,1.2185536623,-0.1735986471,0.2555158138,-0.2242210805,-1.00461483,0.3227193356,-0.9101557732,-0.0922375172,-0.7041832209,1.5307619572,-2.0858910084,1.2753187418,-0.1705823988,-0.2889290452,-1.1175255775,2.0788528919,-0.1412286907,0.0715049654,-0.3436876237,-1.0204751492,-0.6837060452,-0.0595709831,0.4571121633,-1.3772989511,-0.0846873149,-0.0353585258,-0.3383418322,2.2957496643,0.483020395,-1.6999276876,-1.2199845314,-0.9090545774,1.7405790091,0.6313987374,-0.2473620921,-1.0721327066,-0.3265058398,-0.8275199533,0.1419861615,-2.0722570419,-0.548111558,2.0278935432,0.0084102591,1.0654737949,-0.9917159677]},{"index":626,"text":"the

has been a resurgence of sunni activities, as exemplified by isis. and we have to support sunni-arab and kurdish forces against isis, because i believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the united states to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what isis wants. they've advertised that. they want american troops back

us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of american troops into syria and iraq to fight isis. and we do have to form a coalition. i know how hard that is. i have formed them. i put together a coalition, including arabs, with respect to libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto iran. and you have to really work hard at it. and the final thing i would say, bringing

way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition. there's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages. and the worst type of concentration, secretary clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot. and that's why today you still cannot support, as i do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we

government to enforce our immigration laws, and we will not be able to do anything on immigration until we first prove to the american people that illegal immigration is under control. and we can do that. we know what it takes to do that. it takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. it takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. it takes a mandatory e-verify system and a mandatory entry\/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. after we have done that, the second thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal immigration system. and after we have done those two things, i think the american people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn't otherwise violated our laws -- because if they're a criminal they can't stay. they'll have to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. and ultimately, they'll given a work permit and that's all they're gonna be allowed to have for at least 10 years. but you can't get to that third step until you have done the other two things, and that was the lesson we learned in 2013. there is no trust that the federal government will enforce the law. they will not support you until you see it done

unfortunately. they set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum. not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. and we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state. now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st century and what we need to do with our kids? we need to start connecting them to the real world. we need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st century, not the jobs of 20 years ago. we need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their k through 12 they ought to be connected with

certainly shouldn't have a commander-in-chief who sends a message to our adversaries as to how far we're going to go, and how far we're willing to fight, so i'm not putting a troop number. what i'm saying is lift the political restrictions. when you do that, you empower our military personnel already there to work with the kurd and the sunni allies, to reclaim the territory taken by isis. and to do so in a way that allows that isis doesn't go back in syria, as we were just talking about here. that is the fundamental problem going forward. we have a president -- and hillary clinton was a part

can continue to do so from any company in america they want to buy it from. otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country. and if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. and that, i think, is a much better approach than obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy. it is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time. it is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. and i will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all

situation. this country was -- declared its independence in 1776. in less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. and the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. those are the fuels that drive it. and what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is

down, society breaks down. you can't have a strong nation without strong values, and no one is born with strong values. they have to be taught to you in strong families and reinforced in you in strong communities. and so when we set out to do tax reform, we endeavor to have a pro-family tax code, and we endeavor to do it because we know how difficult it is for families in the 21st century to afford the cost of living. it is expensive to raise children in the 21st century, and families that are raising children are raising the future taxpayers of the united states, and everything costs more. in 35 out of 50 states, child care costs more than college. there are millions of people watching this broadcast tonight that understand exactly what i'm talking about. they don't know how they're going to make that payment every month, and if they can't make it, they can't work, because someone needs to watch their kids during the day. they don't know how they're going to save for their kids' future, to go to college. and so, yes, i have a child tax credit increase, and i'm proud of it. i am proud that i have a pro-family tax code, because the pro- family tax plan i have will strengthen the most important institution in the -- in the country, the family.","class":1,"tokens":[1.116257906,2.8619456291,-0.7639858127,1.4831141233,-0.245237425,-0.0953098759,-1.4992442131,0.4627349377,-0.895660162,1.1564407349,-0.6155311465,-0.691275835,-0.0261274502,-0.6540654898,-1.230365634,0.8311593533,-0.84265095,-0.7296657562,2.06341362,-1.6644060612,-2.7848303318,2.413860321,0.6117792726,1.1048089266,-1.5989766121,-1.4089887142,-2.8648657799,1.2946068048,-0.2662431896,1.722383976,-0.5719949007,1.6591067314,1.6066235304,-2.4575273991,0.0078401202,1.7400352955,-1.1582949162,-1.9427450895,0.2729173303,-0.2360770404,-1.2462198734,1.0815740824,-0.2716399133,-1.6092591286,-2.9233994484,0.3189992011,2.4055819511,0.4448947012,2.334318161,-1.4245871305]},{"index":1043,"text":"well

plan to end it at all. you know, i'm reminded of that that is the same position that marco took in iowa on ethanol subsidies. when i campaigned in iowa, i took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies. marco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty. well, someday it should end, just not now. and, frankly, i think we need a president

median income in america. i believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains. i believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil. and if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college

centers, along with private prisons, which i think are really against the common good and the rule of law. and with respect to the 2007 bill, this was ted kennedy's bill. and i think ted kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done. and i was proud to stand with him and support

their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.1455195248,1.3014729023,-0.9862400293,0.6225427389,-0.4242589474,2.0029249191,-0.9096290469,-0.4847224951,-1.0454744101,1.0195235014,-1.525932312,1.7953666449,0.3382209539,-0.098513253,-1.3684635162,-2.3576211929,-1.7930402756,0.5795040727,-0.612778306,-0.5570460558,0.288498342,1.8963493109,1.1668781042,1.150241971,-0.0403929055,-0.1695028096,-1.8962188959,0.8380731344,0.7937265038,-0.6692530513,1.1765478849,0.4727505744,-0.3614500761,0.2835379541,-1.1785846949,1.315734148,0.2167230844,-0.1988892704,-0.8814001679,1.0448948145,-0.5916719437,-0.129856959,0.3668810129,-0.2234197557,-1.622615099,-0.2524986863,2.040532589,0.6630815268,0.8850614429,0.1842000335]},{"index":1333,"text":"yes,

with executive power can be undone with executive power, and i intend to do that.","class":1,"tokens":[0.0817241818,0.0013384792,-0.1141856387,1.352850914,-0.590418756,0.4864518642,-2.350726366,1.0408664942,0.0818199664,-0.3552576005,-0.2762196958,-0.6675717235,-1.434671998,-0.4446375966,-0.97808671,0.8251290917,0.6077179313,-0.7590377927,-0.0542168543,0.7679797411,-0.5661625862,-0.9404459596,0.0266269632,-0.9215039611,0.4150979221,0.7692354321,-0.9460667372,0.7083011866,-1.2718327045,0.0322101414,-0.7118940353,-0.0335585028,-0.5514399409,0.3718050122,-0.8847975731,0.0743419528,-0.3310061395,-0.8235968351,0.9628622532,-0.7340984344,-0.9124975801,1.5650494099,0.4590826631,-1.9356455803,-1.3014433384,0.7006050348,-0.9593644142,0.1859675795,0.9521007538,0.0767799988]},{"index":1371,"text":"i

let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. but you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make

whether they could make some inroads in the baltics. we know that they are deeply engaged in supporting assad because they want to have a place in the middle east. they have a naval base, they have an

support our partners in nato, and we have to send a very clear message to putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. the best way to do

will turn it into a mandate. in fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it. and they will use common core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states.","class":1,"tokens":[0.476187557,1.8550926447,-1.6581995487,0.9517602324,-0.6831479073,-0.5501877069,-1.0719784498,1.8460572958,-0.5998365283,-0.8619718552,-0.1137312576,0.2851239443,-0.5747535825,0.8778509498,-1.3242268562,1.61944592,0.0442071073,0.2858509123,0.0073596239,-0.0736305863,-0.2071900815,0.1632542163,1.3290090561,-0.5018895864,1.2240595818,-0.4539527595,-0.462970823,0.741771698,-0.1496947408,1.3144421577,1.0445399284,0.8944824934,0.451890707,-0.8603611588,0.1829974949,0.08120884,-1.1168301105,1.7230600119,-1.708388567,1.6317317486,0.4794493318,0.5853317976,3.006623745,-1.4624860287,-1.356046319,0.6868242025,-0.5201352239,0.671690762,1.0658746958,0.8104870915]},{"index":1550,"text":"well,

have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining american democracy, which allows wall street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice. and aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. and that's an economy where ordinary americans are working longer hours for low wagers. they are worried to death about the future of their kids. and yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent. and then in addition to that, the american people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. they see more people in jail in the united states of america than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. we're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow americans. they see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on wall street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. no criminal records for them. i think what our campaign is indicating is that the american people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. they want a political revolution in which millions of americans stand up, come together, not let the trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a

let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they're related. as i've said many times before, my parents were never rich people. my father was a bartender. my mother was a maid. they worked for a living. but they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves. we call that the american dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. it is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people. what makes america special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful. the problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. if i thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, i would be all for it, but it isn't. in the 20th century, it's a disaster. if you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine. and that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated. here's the best way to raise wages. make america the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. for the life of me, i don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education. welders make more money than philosophers. we need more welders and less philosophers.","class":1,"tokens":[0.9151281118,1.9796717167,-1.7250285149,1.7077020407,-0.9298421741,1.131488204,-0.8117282391,0.3002988696,0.2842870355,-1.70219028,-0.7858532071,0.5863133669,0.9218817353,0.0600165427,-2.5631194115,-0.4246327579,1.4656738043,-0.5987932682,0.2944726348,-1.680087924,-1.072806716,0.9995241761,0.116021283,0.2652787864,-1.380076766,-0.981502831,-0.8945707679,-0.1145577282,1.1696753502,1.0738887787,-0.1093133911,2.6763911247,-0.7843335271,0.220238626,-0.3332524002,-0.3199388981,1.4923580885,0.295951426,-2.4836339951,-0.0196111258,0.4316111505,0.0899308473,-0.0864427313,-0.2545772493,-2.164645195,-0.7194055319,2.4917907715,0.3065992296,3.117112875,-0.0283564273]},{"index":1591,"text":"...

is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it. so why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating? why are there five even bigger wall street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on wall street? because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business. you see, folks, this is how socialism starts. government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem. this is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back. the student loan problem has been created by government. government trying to level the playing field between internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem. the fcc jumping in now and saying, \"we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the internet,\" is going to create massive problems. but guess who pushed for that regulation? the big internet companies. this is what's going on. big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage. it's why you see walgreens buying rite aid. it's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together. it's you see the health insurance companies getting together. it's why you see the banks consolidating. and meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed. community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed. community banks are going out of business. big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected,

it's too expensive to do business there. the tax rate is too high. the government regulations are too extensive. this year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next. so, i think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again. if the economy of puerto rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments. so, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland. they're united states

easy. but before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after. and in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of assad, a terrible dictator. but i think in syria the

network of terrorism. and thirdly, to do more to keep us safe. under each of those three parts of my plan, i have very specific recommendations about what to do. obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an american-led air campaign, we have to have arab and kurdish troops on the ground. secondly, we've got to go after everything from north africa to south asia and beyond. and then, most importantly, here at home, i think there are three things that we have to get right. we have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information. that now includes the internet, because we have seen that isis is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence. that means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies. they can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists. we've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning. and we must work more

think -- i think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement. we both believe there has to be more money going into the social security system. i've said i'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the social security trust fund. i have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. first, rather than expand benefits for everyone, i do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. i want to take care of women. when the social security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. and women have been disadvantaged ever since. they do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. and the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their social security monthly payment. so

israel, when hamas was raining rockets down on them, i publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against israel? the next day michael bloomberg, another new york billionaire, got on a plane, a

thank you, and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the democratic debates. i'm hillary clinton. i have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady, as a senator from new york, and as

available not just for her, but for all of our children. i have spent a very long time -- my entire adult life -- looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her god-given potential. i've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and i've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. at the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them. and then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one. right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. so i have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families. and i want to do more to help us balance family and work. i believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but i also believe it's about time we had paid family leave for american families and join the rest of the

workers and jobs are going overseas. we're driving jobs overseas. and the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. but i'll tell you who else is

easy to talk about the problems. but do you have a solution to fix it? and i think the solution is several things. number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting american workers first, not the corporate board room. number two, we need to lift the regulations on american businesses here so we see jobs coming back. and number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan i've introduced

500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster. i've spent my whole life fighting to defend the bill of rights and the constitution. i can tell you, for voters that care

for my program, by the way, through a tax on wall street speculation, which will not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt, a major crisis in this country.","class":0,"tokens":[0.4265891612,-0.1802231669,-0.6236847639,1.513240695,0.4460022449,0.6475512385,0.8003257513,0.2608553469,-1.5220389366,-1.3086998463,0.5553530455,0.9012398124,-1.5025475025,0.2809804976,-1.7852141857,0.3693738282,0.2372356802,0.4983277321,-0.7082202435,0.0583296046,0.960698843,1.8968200684,0.9988979697,0.3140223324,0.7226160169,0.074013263,-0.7375381589,0.8320969343,-1.0351936817,0.9011307359,0.0750088841,0.0554156601,1.0653048754,-0.7080862522,-0.2715870142,1.3333320618,-1.6747319698,1.5435036421,-1.3184517622,0.0965325907,1.5953378677,-0.2939096689,0.3925738931,-1.0398424864,-1.8929425478,1.1545425653,1.8803557158,1.5912688971,0.879902184,-1.0146869421]},{"index":2178,"text":"...

heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world; one of the heroes who we should recognize in the middle east is king abdullah ii of jordan. this small country has welcomed in many refugees. and abdullah said something recently, very important. he said, yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of islam. we the muslims should lead the effort on the ground. and i believe he is absolutely right.","class":0,"tokens":[1.7974736691,0.2695455551,-0.5155233741,0.6231897473,0.9896661639,0.9641079307,-0.0521128513,1.8847831488,0.4847592413,-0.8371311426,1.5808190107,1.0404257774,-1.9648065567,0.3238839507,1.3585095406,1.0800174475,1.2861220837,-1.4429597855,0.7662265301,-0.7836170197,-1.0008960962,1.2721483707,-0.7337563038,-0.3336296082,1.6116911173,1.882723093,0.9224508405,-1.2228434086,0.9672470093,-1.5636056662,-1.3384717703,-1.3653492928,1.8416780233,2.0312230587,-2.5300672054,-1.4822235107,0.2089815885,-0.4541393518,1.8234982491,-1.0743459463,-0.3389407098,-0.2524009645,0.6648214459,-0.335010618,-1.1265605688,0.490473479,0.5744841695,1.5701417923,-0.384843111,-2.5136675835]},{"index":2227,"text":"mr.

strengthened the tools of national security and law enforcement to go after terrorists. it gave us greater tools and we are seeing those tools work right now in san bernardino. and in particular, what it did is the prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. when you had a terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily land lines. the usa freedom act expands that so now we have cell phones, now we have internet phones, now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad

i support free trade deals that are good for america. we're 5 percent of the world's population. if all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. we have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things. the problem is we're a low-tariff country. to import something into the united states is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. and so i am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that america can sell things to all these people around the world. there are good trade deals and there are bad ones. so for example, here in florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with colombia. it's allowed flower exporters to come into the united states but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. we have a surplus with colombia. on the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. bottom line is i believe that america, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. if it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century.","class":1,"tokens":[0.9182779193,1.4703943729,-1.5685456991,2.8426349163,-1.4050531387,1.9134670496,-0.7296307683,-2.0185136795,-0.3220186532,-1.1203647852,1.124022603,1.1661263704,0.6245910525,0.7442407608,-2.6433644295,1.8609534502,2.5120689869,-1.0192317963,-2.1528346539,-0.3998479843,-0.1430422515,1.9751876593,-1.0653135777,1.3870632648,0.8463082314,2.3330574036,-0.7645394206,1.0480000973,-1.1776427031,-1.4543157816,1.4203666449,-0.2956878543,0.7686011195,-0.3255625665,-1.8907021284,0.7588785887,1.4353301525,-0.8943365812,-1.747762084,-0.7753065228,-0.7106381059,1.4562211037,-0.4630438685,1.1861416101,0.3585608006,-0.5940743089,-0.9182120562,2.3103349209,-0.6332259178,-0.6871450543]},{"index":2256,"text":"well,

reagan administration. in the senate, i spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one. i also wrote and passed the best piece of veterans education legislation in history, the post 9\/11 g.i. bill. i brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion. i led what later became called the strategic pivot to asia two years before president obama was elected. i know where my loyalties are. my mother grew up in the poverty of east arkansas chopping cotton, picking strawberries. three of her seven siblings died in childhood. my wife, hong, came to this country as a refugee from war torn vietnam -- learned english, a language that was not spoken at home, and earned her way into cornell law school. i have five daughters. amy works with disabled veterans, sarah is an emergency room nurse, julia is a massage therapist, emily and georgia are still in school. my son jim fought as an infantry marine on the bloody streets of ramadi. you may be sure that in a webb administration, the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home, and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common sense foreign policy.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.2157642096,0.7124745846,0.3519780636,1.9801037312,0.612166822,0.3129517734,-0.5522475243,-0.2571846843,-2.1777057648,-1.299654007,-1.4249098301,1.6323306561,-3.731058836,-0.4459797442,1.3676172495,-3.2290999889,-0.5889342427,2.0236954689,2.6686966419,-0.844424367,0.8470243812,-1.7826719284,1.6806507111,-1.7105592489,-2.8716151714,1.0771431923,-0.9096619487,0.0804714188,1.0545296669,-0.5180045366,2.5429830551,0.1967264563,0.2508688271,1.4578152895,-0.6344524622,2.072726965,0.1885317713,3.0529913902,2.8279726505,0.0151913231,0.082202509,1.1370220184,0.9190645218,0.1041404009,-0.4536059499,0.8579291701,1.3992359638,-0.6779571772,2.60536623,-3.8819639683]},{"index":2294,"text":"you

know, i completely agree with senator sanders. the first speech i gave in this campaign back in april was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration. the statistics from

lead to the death of dontre hamilton right here in milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us. his family certainly believes that. and so do i. so we have work to do. there have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. president obama's policing commission came out with some. i have fully endorsed those. but we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect. and, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level. but, i would also add this. there are other racial discrepancies. really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities. so, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.","class":0,"tokens":[3.5579693317,0.9788452387,-0.4499922693,1.3228734732,-1.0399359465,1.8397197723,1.8092167377,0.608623147,0.8854501247,-0.6047375202,0.5950381756,0.494343251,0.0586187653,-1.676820755,-0.4680410624,0.2289926559,0.357103765,0.2244352251,0.4097152948,-2.3137328625,0.884580195,0.6005998254,3.2653946877,0.0151177812,0.3373422623,0.7777239084,0.0001479202,0.7761852741,1.1426907778,0.9025425911,1.8913341761,0.3229877651,0.4522903562,0.9094624519,0.8710973859,-2.4264657497,-1.7001409531,0.0223939493,1.7417535782,-0.9353296161,-0.3908670843,0.1255424321,0.5026501417,0.5690531731,-1.1370319128,0.8561989069,1.9244396687,1.2664903402,0.0766953677,-0.5392921567]},{"index":2305,"text":"i'd

reduced because of obamacare. this is the truck drivers and the steel workers and the mechanics with calluses on their hands who have seen their wages not grow year after year after year while the cost of living goes up. this is all the young people coming out of school with student loans up to their eyeballs that aren't able to find a job. and i don't think the people of america are interested in a bunch of bickering school children. they are interested in solutions, not slogans. it's easy to say, make things better, make things great. you can even print it and put it on a baseball cap. but the question is, do you understand the principles that made america great in the first place? as president, i will repeal every word of obamacare. i will pull back the regulators that are killing small businesses. and we will pass a simple flat tax and abolish the irs. and what that's going to do, megyn, is small businesses are going to explode. we are going to see millions of high-paying jobs. we are going to see wages going up. we are going to see opportunity. that's where our focus needs to be. that's where my focus is. and that is why our campaign is the only campaign that over and over again has beaten donald trump to date, and it's why we are the one campaign that going forward can and will beat donald trump in this election.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.6497861147,-0.1929587871,-0.3852727711,0.3042692244,2.081923008,1.9970482588,-0.5353649855,-0.007637185,-0.0323469564,-1.7174705267,-1.6023389101,1.6609282494,-0.3139360845,0.2609990239,-0.61787045,2.6044209003,0.9536056519,0.3365306258,-0.6457930803,-0.1923131794,-1.8510822058,1.4653178453,1.7170461416,0.4396713972,-0.3732409477,-0.1946900785,-2.5929701328,1.6479161978,1.1903223991,-0.4939951301,0.4814765155,0.5817444921,0.6770375967,-0.2624467909,-0.7314664125,2.0604815483,-0.7095950246,-0.8383547068,-0.9944845438,1.2407283783,0.604421258,-1.0118933916,-0.6813531518,-0.9313600063,-1.9149639606,0.1592859775,1.5512660742,0.3975762129,1.9576491117,0.2298861146]},{"index":2416,"text":"first

throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now. i want to build on and improve the affordable care act. i would certainly tackle the

let's start -- i've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes -- let's start with why russia is in syria right now. there are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. the first was the invasion of iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in iraq and empowered iran. the second was the arab spring, which created huge vacuums in libya and in syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. and the third was the recent deal allowing iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world. now, i say this as someone who spent five years in the pentagon and who opposed the war in iraq, whose son fought in iraq, i've fought in vietnam. but if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with china. and we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. we need to do it because of the way they treat their own

they mentioned is when i was running for senate -- unlike hillary clinton, i don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. when i was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. he put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife heidi and i, we ended up investing everything we owned. we took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. and the entire new york times attack -- is that i disclosed that loan on one filing with the united states senate, that was a public filing. but it was not on a second filing with fdic and

violent crime to 30-year lows. but get this. we also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows. so it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police. but there wasn't a single day as mayor of baltimore that i wasn't asked whether i was delivering on the promise i made to police the police. we reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force. in fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force. as a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable. just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force. there's so much work that can be done, so much

on the turkish border, a no-fly zone on the south on the jordanian border. anybody flies in the first time, maybe they can fly out. they fly in there a second time, they will not fly out. and it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be. and it also sends many messages in the middle east that we're still involved. saudi arabia, cut off the funding for the radical clerics, the ones that preach against us. but they're fundamentally our friends. jordan, we want the king to reign for 1,000 years. egypt, they have been our ally and a moderating force in the middle east throughout their history. in the groups -- in the countries of the gulf states of bahrain, the cleveland clinic is opening an operation. clearly we see the same with them. and in israel, we have no better ally in the world, and no more criticizing them in public, we should support them. and finally china, china doesn't own the south china sea, and i give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more. and in the trade agreement, the tpp, it's critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the chinese. they are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend. and finally, i will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics. when the fall comes, and we run against hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected. i have two 16-year-old girls, and i want this country to be strong. we make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble. we must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid. i served in washington as the chairman of the budget committee, and we got the budget balanced. and in ohio, as the ceo, and guess what, we have got to have a ceo mentality and a way to beat hillary clinton and the democracies in the fall. and our ideas have to add up. they have to be solid. and people have to know we have

other universities, i think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have... you know, i recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking. each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture. you know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down. or a young woman who had been performing at president obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member. and, of course, i met the mothers of eric garner and tamir rice, and michael brown and trayvon martin and so many of them who have lost their children. so, your original

you didn't go out and get a cab? he said, no, i don't get cabs in washington, d.c. this was 20 years ago. because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. i couldn't believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in washington, d.c. tell you another story, i was with young people active in the black lives matter movement. a young lady comes up to me and she says, you don't understand what police do in certain black communities. you don't understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and i'm not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we've got to hold police officers accountable, i'm just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people. so to answer your question, i would say, and i think it's similar to what the secretary said, when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto. you don't know what it's like to be poor. you don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car. and i believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be

me -- let me just say this. what a president of the united states has got to do and what is his or her major, i think, responsibility is to, a, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values, that we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity. i voted against the war in iraq because i listened very carefully to what president bush and vice president cheney had to say and i didn't believe them. and if you go to my web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what i feared would happen when i spoke on the floor of the house, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. now i think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where secretary clinton and i disagree is the area of regime change. look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the united states, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. and god only knows saddam hussein was a brutal dictator. we could overthrow assad tomorrow if we wanted to. we got rid of gadhafi. but the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after. and in libya, for example, the united states, secretary clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi. but what happened is a political vacuum developed. isis came in, and now occupies significant territory in libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. but this is nothing new. this has gone on 50 or 60 years where the united states has been involved in overthrowing governments. mossadegh back in 1953. nobody knows who mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of iran. he was overthrown by british and american interests because he threatened oil interests of the british. and as a result of that, the shah of iran came in, terrible dictator. the result of that, you had the iranian revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. unintended consequences. so i believe as president i will look very carefully about unintended consequences. i will do everything i can to make certain that the united states and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the middle east.","class":0,"tokens":[3.0135879517,-1.0475233793,-1.0028104782,-1.0375461578,-1.9391026497,-0.9655874968,-1.4777822495,-0.6341338158,-0.8106677532,-1.541461587,0.2974004447,-0.2135271728,-0.6777249575,0.0558487214,0.048115585,-0.1968627125,0.7435888648,1.1473141909,-0.4271059632,-0.038543608,-1.687587738,-0.6321483254,0.3992995918,-1.227368474,2.2228269577,3.5876746178,-0.8801774979,-0.0660498962,-1.0621750355,-0.4694980681,-1.3565944433,1.3432204723,1.5731830597,2.746026516,-2.8018653393,-3.1650736332,-0.0463626906,0.8366026282,0.4195590317,0.1307880729,-0.419606626,0.106497094,-0.7958642244,0.8328301907,-1.3975017071,-0.6246410012,-1.675250411,-0.8581054807,-1.1587224007,-1.2982182503]},{"index":2836,"text":"i'm

forward. so what i would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this. as president, i would make the administrator of usaid an actual cabinet member. we have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as general dempsey said. and i do believe, and i would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat. they have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of syria and iraq. we cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of

was the language he was most comfortable in. and he became a conservative, even though he got his news in spanish. and so, i do give interviews in spanish, and here's why -- because i believe that free enterprise and limited government is the best way to help people who are trying to achieve upward mobility. and if they get their news in spanish, i want them to hear that directly from me. not from a translator at

i have what i call the new college compact. because i think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know. number one, states have been dis-investing in higher education. in fact, i think new hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country. so states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education. so under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system. secondly, i don't believe in free tuition for everybody. i believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead. so i have proposed debt free tuition, which i think is affordable and i would move a lot of the pell grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense. so i put all of this together, again, on my website and i've gotten such a good response. but i want to quickly say, one of the areas that senator sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems. free college, a single payer system for health--and it's been estimated we're looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget. and i have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run. and i think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that i have proposed i will tell you exactly how i'm going to pay for it; including college.","class":0,"tokens":[0.6877661943,2.161532402,-2.1348261833,3.6596200466,-0.3118074834,0.3405096829,-2.3713245392,0.2777267396,-1.641395092,0.9854236245,-0.4630990326,2.0373606682,1.4725233316,-1.7196781635,-1.8227602243,-0.7788502574,0.8199469447,-0.2126309425,-0.6819280386,-0.9934578538,2.9195702076,1.9387437105,0.1066478938,0.4429113865,0.0059018084,-2.0603375435,0.2448131442,2.8830535412,-2.1535568237,0.2274280936,-0.1157118753,-0.594609797,0.6832649708,0.5197687149,1.0382854939,-1.233520627,-1.1325241327,0.7614825964,-0.4604730606,-1.9800378084,1.0467734337,0.9195831418,1.7775967121,-1.4785426855,-3.0269687176,0.011263256,1.3749697208,0.5856572986,-0.1417099833,-0.8021715283]},{"index":2972,"text":"let's

the economy growing? how do we bring back economic growth? because economic growth, it's foundational to every other challenge we have. as you rightly noted, from 2008 to today, our economy has grown 1.2 percent a year on average. the obama economy is a disaster, and the imf is telling us this is a new normal. it doesn't have to be. if you look at the history of america, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth. the first is tax reform. and as you noted, i have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every american that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade. the second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses. and the third element is sound money. every time we've pursued all three of those -- whether in the 1920s with calvin coolidge or the 1960s with jfk or the 1980s with ronald reagan -- the result has been incredible

more on the prescribing end of it. there are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction. and we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we

with respect to syria, i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made. the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria. the agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to. you know, the russians wanted to buy time. are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. but i would add this. you know, the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution. at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together. this is incredibly complicated, because we've got iran as a big player, in addition to russia. we have saudi arabia, turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. this is one of the areas i've disagreed with senator sanders on, who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria, which i think would be a grave mistake. putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me. trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. so let's support what secretary kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. and remember, the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups. so as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and the like. so we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the russians.","class":0,"tokens":[0.3119677603,0.9001582861,-1.6331490278,0.5171304941,0.1310349405,1.6878045797,0.4450034499,2.5979418755,2.1064727306,1.0829316378,-0.9785109758,0.9524604678,-3.1978018284,-1.0504863262,1.1927037239,-0.2960959971,-1.9237114191,-1.376922965,-0.3257380724,1.7405254841,2.4227602482,-2.0074477196,0.9142817259,-4.5288081169,3.2482397556,0.6341196895,-0.5584204793,1.4892755747,0.6439476013,-4.8079166412,-1.6097010374,1.005928874,-1.6417443752,1.1220532656,-0.3553456962,-4.9239621162,-2.2791938782,0.394306004,2.4195489883,0.8180267215,-0.2616420388,0.05798335,-0.1264174581,-0.2186620384,-2.4951827526,-1.2461006641,-0.411549896,-0.6706542969,-0.087744765,-0.0186136104]},{"index":3143,"text":"thank

i am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in america, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths. people with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived. this is a remarkable and horrifying fact. and that's why i've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal. you know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us? do people not care about all of our sacrifice? and i'm going to do everything i can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country. i particularly appreciate the proposal that congressman jim clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. and you know what? if you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out. so, yes, i do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is. and that's why, as president, i will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.","class":0,"tokens":[1.36247015,3.4361205101,-1.9896459579,1.5593175888,-0.3083927333,1.7223848104,0.5300825834,-1.3294115067,-0.5548399687,-0.5710552335,0.4337575138,0.1855268776,0.4307442605,-1.1430556774,-0.5947092175,-1.0982306004,1.1880620718,-1.6433804035,1.1519006491,-0.0470429957,-0.6202238798,0.9095580578,0.9367653131,2.7238826752,0.2527478337,0.4190751612,-0.4730620384,2.3657310009,-0.7600440383,-0.1028568372,1.4744167328,2.621557951,0.0749604106,0.0849975571,0.5759145617,0.5210027695,-1.1490340233,-0.1599671841,2.3025944233,-0.6695129275,-0.5930265784,0.8546792865,-0.3596357107,-0.4213888645,-1.7149043083,-1.4705843925,3.3526861668,-0.475122273,0.2230695337,0.8882384896]},{"index":3166,"text":"well,

said in that initial statement that if the evidence indicated that edward snowden violated the law, he should be prosecuted for violating the law. and, indeed, since then, the evidence is clear that not only does snowden violate the law, but it appears he committed treason. treason is defined under the constitution as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of america, and what snowden did made it easier for terrorists to avoid detection. and snowden's comments afterwards, and his behavior afterwards, he fled to russia, he fled to china. his conducts afterwards indicates that he was not a

safer, that's healthier, where they have more opportunity than our parents and grandparents gave to us. tonight, what you listened to was a healthy exchange of ideas about how we'd do that, that which we have always proven, the capacity to do better than any nation in the world, to take actions that include more of our people more fully in the economic, social and political life of our country. when you listened to the republican debate the other night, you heard a lot of anger and you had a lot of fear. well, they can have their anger and they can have their fear, but anger and fear never built america. we build our country by adopting wage and labor policies, including comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway of citizenship for all. we do it by investing in our country, by investing in infrastructure, by investing in the skills and the talents of our people with debt-free college, and we can do it again. and we also create a better future for our kids when we square our shoulders to the great challenges of our times, whether it's terror trying to undermine our values or republican presidential candidates trying to get us to surrender our freedoms and our values in the face of this threat. the other big challenge we have is climate change. the greatest business opportunity to come to the united states of america in 100 years. we need to embrace this. i have put forward a plan that does this, that moves us to 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050. join this campaign for the future. new leadership is what our country needs to move us out of these divided and polarized times. thank

first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop gadhafi from committing massacres against his people. the united states was asked to support the europeans and the arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, i recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of gadhafi. i think that what libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path. now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the arab spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that isis and other terrorist groups do. but what we're seeing happening in libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among libyans themselves to try to dislodge isis from sirte, the home town of gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government. you know, this is not easy work. we did a lot to help. we did as much as we could because the libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept. but we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be

the united states is to protect the people of the united states. i visited with a number of our neighbors in northern virginia at a mosque last friday. and as i looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, i also looked in the eyes of veterans. i looked into the eyes of boy scouts. i looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms. what our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger. and that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other. what our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as americans. we will rise to challenge of isil and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy. but we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths. we are a better country than this. our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the statue of liberty. and america's best days are in front of us if we move forward

they've never said about me is that i'm misunderstood. and so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a christie administration, they know we're going to keep it. next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. and this president, given what ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right. it's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that secretary kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better. the president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does secretary clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. if you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give

islamists, especially from isis. this is the most sophisticated terror group that has ever threatened the world or the united states of america. they are actively recruiting americans. the attacker in san bernardino was an american citizen, born and raised in this country. he was a health inspector; had a newborn child and left all that behind to kill 14 people. we also understand that this is a group that's growing in its governance of territory. it's not just iraq and syria. they are now a predominant group in libya. they are beginning to pop up in afghanistan. they are increasingly involved now in attacks in yemen. they have jordan in their sights. this group needs to be confronted with serious proposals. and this is a very significant threat we face. and the president has left us unsafe. he spoke the other night to the american people to reassure us. i wish he hadn't spoken at all. he made things worse. because what he basically said was we are going to keep doing what

this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning. i haven't changed anything with it. and, look, my view is, we need economic growth. everything starts with economic growth. and how do you get it? common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget. that gives you economic growth. i did it when i was in washington, as the budget committee chairman, negotiating actually with democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in ohio. but here's the thing that i believe. economic growth is not an end unto itself. we have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise. of course, our friends in the hispanic community, our friends in the african-american community, the promise of america is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone. it's what jack kemp used to say. a rising tide lifts all boats, not just some
