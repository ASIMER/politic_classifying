neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves. we call that the american dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. it is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people. what makes america special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard

to make people more expensive than a machine. and that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated. here's the best way to raise wages. make america the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. for the life of me, i don't know why we have

this? because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. and the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're americans and they carry the load. so let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country. that's what i think we need to do.","class":1,"tokens":[-1.4951776266,1.5476250648,-0.9362234473,0.0636330321,-0.7428962588,-0.2677574754,-0.2139478177,-0.3974640369,-0.7144314647,-0.2685981095,-1.0984393358,0.4139615297,-0.0874892399,0.7534741759,-0.5865998268,2.5146389008,-0.908734858,1.2135822773,0.3913837373,1.4129171371,1.1955138445,0.7757552266,-0.5711465478,-0.281612128,-2.5233442783,1.0478413105,-0.4361799955,-0.3314028084,-0.4861010015,0.1132012159,0.5073677301,2.2122030258,-0.0790391192,0.0749400035,-1.4914362431,0.85353297,0.4988932908,0.7202610373,-2.6428775787,0.6982921958,1.1804125309,0.3487770855,-0.9606402516,0.3126521111,0.5777456164,-1.059782505,1.4732433558,0.2996872962,1.7489440441,-0.6017333865,1.1864871979,0.9694975615,2.5015041828,-1.3112775087,0.135934338,0.9368519783,1.5262989998,-0.4713072777,0.8513795137,1.923079133]},{"index":80,"text":"we

president is going to start in 2017, not in 1990 -- you know, 30 years ago, or when my brother started. the world is dramatically different. and i believe that we need to restore america's presence

i'm glad you asked that, maria. here's -- here's our plan. we've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform. if you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know. and what that's led to over $2 trillion of american companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. and who can blame them? they pay tax once overseas. they don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back. so beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money. bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the united states. we'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. and i would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country. it would not necessitate us raising any taxes. it would bring the money back into the united states to help build jobs by american companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. and -- and -- and the last piece of this, maria, is this. you know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in america. he's penalized -- and doesn't understand. in fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers. you've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the obama administration. that's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. we'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively. and remember this -- i'm credible on this for this reason: americans for tax reform says that i've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in american history. we don't need to raise taxes to get this

in libya?\" three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong. if it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running

make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose. and you know what? ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- i not only did it in washington, i did it in ohio,

hatred that goes on in our society. you know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity. you know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names. where did that spirit come from in america? it did not come from our judeo-christian roots, i can tell you that. and wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong. and let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us. the majority of people in american actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made america great. they've been beaten into submission. it's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.","class":1,"tokens":[-1.5079542398,0.0766935274,-1.732460022,1.6133234501,1.0776666403,-1.9420306683,-0.0774036869,1.4094173908,-0.4268033504,-0.0345476866,-0.7958804369,-0.0300092604,-1.3095197678,2.2360658646,1.3037610054,-1.7478792667,-0.1264130026,1.014644146,0.6135011911,-0.3618730307,-0.8880948424,-0.1781791598,-0.3221673667,1.0372464657,-0.5585305691,-1.1172100306,0.4279337823,-0.1699543744,0.6795606613,-1.2477536201,1.0503695011,-0.1935973912,0.3637623191,-0.0165351331,0.2739285231,0.6080511808,2.6833229065,-0.4115633667,-1.2585631609,0.6477087736,1.5013912916,0.5801285505,0.1383306384,-0.6875402331,0.5885818601,-0.0833630338,-0.9933766723,1.5364477634,-0.0064625521,-2.579886198,0.2172297686,-0.290361464,-0.3725863099,0.4761909842,0.4346031547,1.3011585474,0.6796882153,-0.5413296819,0.3443886638,1.8681697845]},{"index":239,"text":"our

right path. now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the arab spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that isis and other

isis from sirte, the home town of gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government. you know, this is not easy work. we did a lot to help. we did as much as we could because the libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept. but we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be

federal government is a limited government, limited by the constitution, which delineates its powers. if it's not in the constitution, it does not belong to the federal government. it belongs to states, local communities and the private sector. it's about free enterprise, which is an economic model that allows everyone to rise without pulling anyone down. the reason why free enterprise is the greatest economic model in the history of the world is because it's the only economic model where you can make poor people richer without making rich people poor. and it's about a strong national

participate in something you really don't like, that's a whole 'nother issue, ok? another issue. here's what i'd like to see happen. the supreme court ruled, i don't agree with the ruling. i'm of

there was a book written called \"the death of common sense.\" we need to bring it back. but at the end of the day, if somebody is being pressured to participate in something that is against their deeply-held religious beliefs, then we're going to have to think about dealing with the law. but you know what, i'd rather people figure this out without having to put another law on the books and have more arguments in this country. why don't we come together as a country, respect one another, love one another and lift this country? i think that's what people want. so thanks for

some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. i think what president obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first african american president,

the united states is to protect the people of the united states. i visited with a number of our neighbors in northern virginia at a mosque last friday. and as i looked out there at the eyes of our

our freedoms. what our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger. and that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other. what our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as americans. we will rise to challenge of isil and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy. but we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths. we are a better country than this. our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the statue of liberty. and america's best days are in front of us if we move forward

with respect to syria, i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made. the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria. the agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to. you know, the russians wanted to buy time. are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. but i would add this. you know, the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution. at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together. this is incredibly complicated, because we've got iran as a big player, in addition to russia. we have saudi arabia, turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. this is one of the areas i've disagreed with senator sanders on, who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria, which i think would be a grave mistake. putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me. trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. so let's support what secretary kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. and remember, the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups. so as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and the like. so we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the

we're using makes it very easy for them, makes it very easy for the big corporations, quite frankly, at these very low interest rates to buy back their stock and to drive the price of that up artificially. those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place. and i think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation. this country was -- declared its independence in 1776. in less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. and the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. those are the fuels that drive it. and what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. if we can get that out, it makes a big difference. and even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. and it's shifted to the individual. so -- and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich. they go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it. and the middle class, when they come to the cash register, have a whole cart full of things that cost 5, 10 or 15 cents more, they notice it. it is hurting the poor. bernie sanders and hillary clinton won't tell you that that's the thing that's really hurting middle class in the core. they'll say it's the rich, take their money, but that won't help. you can take all of the rich's money and it won't make a dent in the problem

with. we need to repeal obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts americans in charge of their health care money again. if your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in america they want to buy it from. otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country. and if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. and that, i think, is a much better approach than obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy. it is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time. it is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. and i will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all

you're coming, you will not get into the united states. number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws. i am the son and grandson of immigrants. and i know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it. we'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new irs agents. we will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs. we'll have mandatory e-verify, a mandatory entry\/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen. we are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either. there will be a process. we will see what the american people are willing to support. but it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones barack obama has forced on us.","class":1,"tokens":[-1.0090755224,1.4890749454,0.2004866898,1.2893924713,1.0133402348,0.9512585998,0.1333584785,0.5579404235,0.234008342,-1.7366673946,-1.3796812296,-0.3323153555,-0.4840125442,-1.6266576052,0.3998928368,0.1098844558,0.283241421,1.3256633282,0.398593694,-1.3989993334,-0.1121332571,-1.6115546227,1.6718356609,-1.231233716,0.2127323896,-0.9122811556,-0.7169231176,-1.6711896658,-0.643625617,1.8955235481,0.7156771421,-1.5906078815,-0.6534407735,-3.3438460827,1.7245627642,0.2986452579,-0.11905808,-1.0040721893,-1.0172185898,1.0270193815,0.6008196473,0.0576426834,-0.9891190529,0.1921191067,0.6027629375,-0.5002114773,-0.5169656873,0.5583232641,-0.6337293386,-0.1723981649,1.4422161579,-0.5548365116,0.4144916236,-1.3220639229,0.4643714428,1.4036569595,-2.0610642433,0.8084156513,0.7844814062,3.2646000385]},{"index":507,"text":"secretary

it's so important. and for those at the bottom, we've got to do what we can to train them so they can move up. but to just look the other way is not acceptable, because, you know what, as the governor

violent, addicted, and abandoned city in america. and i ran and promised people that together we could turn that around. and we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime, or part one crime by more than any other major city in america over the next 10 years. i did not make our city immune to setbacks. but i attended a lot of funerals, including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor african-american neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner. we've saved over a thousand lives in baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together. and the vast majority of them were young and poor and black. it wasn't easy on any day. but we saved lives and we gave our city a better future, improving

the economy growing? how do we bring back economic growth? because economic growth, it's foundational to every other challenge we have. as you rightly noted, from 2008 to today, our economy has grown 1.2 percent a year on average. the obama economy is a disaster, and the imf is telling us this is a new normal. it doesn't have to be. if you look at the history of america, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth. the first is tax reform. and as you noted, i have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every american that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade. the second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses. and the third

gwen and judy, thank you very much for hosting this event. and, pbs, thank you. nine months ago, our campaign began. and when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of vermont. a lot has happened in nine months. and what has happened is, i think, the american people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining american democracy, which allows wall street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice. and aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. and that's an economy where ordinary americans are working longer hours for low wagers. they are worried to death about the future of their kids. and yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent. and then in addition to that, the american people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. they see more people in jail in the united states of america than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. we're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow americans. they see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on wall street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. no criminal records for them. i think what our campaign is indicating is that the american people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. they want a political revolution in which millions of americans stand up, come together, not let the trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors. thank you.","class":0,"tokens":[-2.2611961365,0.5144569278,-0.6141637564,-0.7384470701,2.4327070713,1.2437334061,0.2829616666,-0.6065739989,-0.6650436521,0.39332214,0.9387108088,-1.1020259857,0.9411276579,-0.1691234559,0.5537230372,-1.8498511314,1.2406311035,1.9558663368,0.5227107406,1.1892222166,0.8412214518,0.3929655254,-0.202636674,0.8654660583,-0.8859709501,-0.5806301236,-2.6349606514,-0.7508360147,1.8961331844,0.960262835,0.1691328883,1.1381896734,-1.0677835941,-1.0447955132,0.0089865616,2.7451267242,3.4713354111,-0.629414618,-1.4715074301,-1.2473464012,-0.3959031105,0.7087725401,-1.326346159,0.7968190908,-1.3341910839,1.3508012295,0.5714580417,-2.1747214794,0.2650255561,-0.1066546664,-0.4974651635,1.4024641514,-0.6202488542,-1.2885655165,0.8984497786,-0.9719729424,-0.3900605142,-0.513422668,0.550876677,0.5195626616]},{"index":886,"text":"it's

of the things that made ronald reagan a great president, is that he understood that america was a unique nation, like any other that had existed throughout human history. he knew it was founded on universal principles that were powerful, the dignity of all people, human rights, the rights of all to live in freedom and liberty, and choose their own path in life. he didn't just believe it, he acted on it. that's why bringing down communism was so important to him. if i'm honored with the opportunity to be president, i hope that our air force one will fly, first and foremost, to our allies; in israel, in south korea, and japan. they know we stand with them. that america can be counted on. it would also fly to china, not just to meet with our enemies, not just to meet with those adversaries of ours that are there, but also to meet with those that aspire to freedom and liberty within china. i would even invite them to my inauguration. we would also fly into moscow and into russia. and not just meet with the leaders of russia, but also meet with those who aspire to freedom and liberty in russia. and ultimately, i hope that my air force one, if i become president, will

me tell you this, mr. baker, in terms of the cyber attacks, we have the capability to not only have a defensive posture, but it also to make it clear to people that if you attack us with cyber attacks, we will destroy the mechanisms that you are using to attack us. i want to give you a little trip around the world. i served on the defense committee for 18 years. in the ukraine, arm the people there so they can fight for themselves. in the eastern part of europe, make sure that finland and the baltics know that if the russians move, we move. in syria, yes, a no-fly zone in the north on the turkish border, a no-fly zone on the south on the jordanian border. anybody flies in the first time, maybe they can fly out. they fly in there a second time, they will not fly out. and it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be. and it also sends many messages in the middle east that we're still involved. saudi arabia, cut off the funding for the radical clerics, the ones that preach against us. but they're fundamentally our friends. jordan, we want the king to reign for 1,000 years. egypt, they have been our ally and a moderating force in the middle east throughout their history. in the groups -- in the countries of the gulf states of bahrain, the cleveland clinic is opening an operation. clearly we see the same with them. and in israel, we have no better ally in the world, and no more criticizing them in public, we should support them. and finally china, china doesn't own the south china sea, and i give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more. and in the trade agreement, the tpp, it's critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the chinese. they are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend. and finally, i will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics. when the fall comes, and we run against hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected. i have two 16-year-old girls, and i want this country to be strong. we make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble. we must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid. i served in washington as the chairman of the budget committee, and we got the budget balanced. and in ohio, as the ceo, and guess what, we have got to have a ceo mentality and a way to beat hillary clinton and the democracies in the fall. and our ideas have to add up. they have to be solid. and people have to know we have the confidence to lead america. and as president, i will lead this country, as i have before in washington and in ohio, and will return both on domestic and international affairs. and i appreciate the

problems that exist because of our entitlement problems that will overwhelm and create way too much debt. if we grow at 4 percent, people are going to be lifted out of poverty. the great middle that

law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them. see, in ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.

half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone. you've got to bring people together. you've got to give people hope. and together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal america. and that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.","class":1,"tokens":[0.0633095726,-3.3465104103,-1.4199154377,0.9108595252,-0.3336520791,-2.4649941921,0.8471295834,0.1375696957,-0.0709910542,-1.6201394796,0.4771793187,1.230612278,0.1116420403,-0.4656641781,0.4474824369,-1.003755331,-2.2230136395,1.129234314,-0.0603347309,1.5762575865,-1.572665453,-0.5160657763,-1.009755373,-0.3420051932,-1.8249821663,-0.4389075041,-0.9001443982,-0.2965025008,-1.3721209764,1.0627477169,-0.476197809,1.4311493635,1.5753873587,0.3115341067,-1.5435758829,0.9560559988,3.35394907,-0.1362430155,-0.1688753814,1.3649976254,0.3276398778,0.0160187557,-0.5633707643,-2.2752435207,0.3572258949,0.5046855807,-1.4581782818,1.5249409676,0.4177377522,0.8970164061,-0.4466386735,-1.1232992411,0.0465889014,0.3128504455,-0.1061595604,0.260517776,0.9629713893,-1.4321813583,0.8042630553,-1.2050840855]},{"index":1019,"text":"number

safer, that's healthier, where they have more opportunity than our parents and grandparents gave to us. tonight, what you listened to was a healthy exchange of ideas about how we'd do that, that which we have always proven, the capacity to do better than any nation in the world, to take actions that include more of our people more fully in the economic, social and political life of our country. when you listened to the republican debate the other night, you heard a lot of anger and you had a lot of fear. well, they can have their anger and they can have their fear, but anger and fear never built america. we build our country by adopting wage and labor policies, including comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway of citizenship for all. we do it by investing in our country, by investing in infrastructure, by investing in the skills and the talents of our people with debt-free college, and we can do it again. and we also create a better future for our kids when we square our shoulders to the great challenges of our times, whether it's terror trying to undermine our values or republican presidential candidates trying to get us to surrender our freedoms and our values in the face of this threat. the other big challenge we have is climate change. the greatest business opportunity to come to the united states of america in 100 years. we need to embrace this. i have put forward a plan that does this, that moves us to 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050. join this campaign for the future. new leadership is what our country needs to move us out of these divided and polarized times. thank you.","class":0,"tokens":[0.3322133422,-0.7416014671,0.4077039659,-2.1824269295,1.0557254553,1.6944408417,0.6104770303,2.0435371399,1.5215859413,-0.3492926657,-0.0674425066,1.5336155891,1.0273237228,-0.5686283112,0.6819922328,-1.7036260366,2.2560858727,-0.1569422632,1.1593650579,-0.1618383229,0.8115390539,-1.558275342,0.7162840962,0.2412566543,-0.9784707427,0.7269954085,-0.9588307738,-0.4409361482,1.8561048508,-0.2997611463,-2.800599575,1.1402858496,-1.1135232449,0.3451415598,-0.7636044621,2.3392329216,3.811794281,0.1666137725,-0.4341228008,-1.7213069201,1.0569466352,0.7134847045,-0.8867909908,-1.7884743214,0.0565176755,0.2189391404,-1.4946893454,1.7281707525,-1.0904765129,0.2611161172,2.3762238026,1.9675456285,0.1715884358,-0.0745055228,2.323369503,1.5837934017,-1.1876628399,0.6216931939,0.7898619175,0.1041038409]},{"index":1052,"text":"it's

run by democrats and countries currently run by democrats. so the thing is, let's look for root causes. but i would also say -- lay some blame at the -- the feet of the federal reserve. i think the federal reserve has made this problem worse. by artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money. they're actually talking now about negative interest. the money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in new york. and because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. so what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality. we also find that as the federal reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst. so really we need to reexamine whether we not -- we want a federal reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates. we also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse. but the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a city with a republican mayor or a state with a republican governor.","class":1,"tokens":[1.6077884436,0.9084674716,-0.578761816,0.003752304,-0.6381929517,-2.743522644,0.1846798956,-1.2952669859,-1.3802883625,-1.164547801,-0.8006407022,2.6595158577,-1.493547678,-1.5026715994,2.565030098,0.7439327836,-0.6449751258,1.8919893503,-1.6131675243,2.630338192,0.089095965,-0.4666357338,-0.344638437,0.5852093101,-0.7830759883,-0.2398432642,0.9727196693,0.5344419479,1.1184408665,-1.2143570185,3.1575055122,3.8087778091,-0.8045329452,-0.1633135974,0.0232994314,1.5170618296,1.2594980001,-0.1494767368,0.9779829979,1.4596568346,-1.4385693073,0.9013088346,0.8223800063,0.8505377769,0.4345835149,1.6610251665,-1.8289072514,-0.6664971113,-1.7218009233,-1.3309285641,-0.8515090942,-0.3188508749,-1.1104223728,-0.1486906558,3.0984432697,0.6919413209,0.1395931989,0.8554282188,-0.2818015814,1.2082083225]},{"index":1225,"text":"...and

african-american congressman. and then we kind of separated during the meeting. and then i saw him out later on. and he was sitting there waiting and i said, well, let's go out and get a cab. how come you didn't go out and get a cab? he said, no, i don't get cabs in washington, d.c. this was 20 years ago. because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. i couldn't believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in washington, d.c. tell you another story, i was with young people active in the black lives matter movement. a young lady comes up to me and she says, you don't understand what police do in certain black communities. you don't understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and i'm not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we've got to hold police officers accountable, i'm just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people. so to answer your question, i would say, and i think it's similar to what the secretary said, when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto. you don't know what it's like to be poor. you don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car. and i believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be

israels. instead, here's what the palestinians do. they teach their four- year-old children that killing jews is a glorious thing. here's what hamas does. they launch rockets and terrorist attacks again israel on an ongoing basis. the bottom line is, a deal between israel and the palestinians, given the current makeup of the palestinians, is not possible. and so the next president of the united

truman, do you know what they believed in? they believed that health care should be available to all of our people. i'm on the committee that wrote the affordable care act. i made the affordable care act along with jim clyburn a better piece of legislation. i voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. we are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off. and here's the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. my proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks. that's the vision we need to take.","class":0,"tokens":[0.0711593106,0.9710785151,0.1148259342,-0.7240974307,1.0804275274,-0.5728148222,0.5221135616,0.0107148979,0.2189494371,-0.590562582,-1.5372927189,0.4808703363,2.0420062542,-1.6323518753,0.572065711,0.1280828863,-1.1240923405,0.6556630731,-0.6852502227,1.6367542744,0.6550133228,0.6069197059,-0.1216703877,-1.7101465464,0.8004174232,0.2414689213,-1.6277304888,-0.9413574338,1.1138875484,0.0050860476,0.178119421,-0.1291926801,-0.5809007287,-0.3128161132,0.2310269177,-0.9866101146,2.4373950958,0.5088888407,-1.1320393085,-1.2692996264,0.1887182593,0.0814772993,0.6554862857,0.1969226897,0.0664352402,0.5060229897,-0.5601882935,-0.6586908698,0.0696324483,-0.0118167643,0.0683928803,-1.1403915882,0.0520892367,-0.8887876868,-1.1828006506,-0.0062025166,0.3751801848,-0.4125730991,0.8662379384,1.2841240168]},{"index":1351,"text":"all

slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. first, rather than expand benefits for everyone, i do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. i want to take care of women. when the social security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. and women have been disadvantaged ever since. they do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. and the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their social security monthly payment. so

what president bush and vice president cheney had to say and i didn't believe them. and if you go to my web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what i feared would happen when i spoke on the floor of the house, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. now i think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where secretary clinton and i disagree is the area of regime change. look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the united states, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. and god only knows saddam hussein was a brutal dictator. we could overthrow assad tomorrow if we wanted to. we got rid of gadhafi. but the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after. and in libya, for example, the united states, secretary clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi. but what happened is a political vacuum developed. isis came in, and now occupies significant territory in libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. but this is nothing new. this has gone on 50 or 60 years where the united states has been involved in overthrowing governments. mossadegh back in 1953. nobody knows who mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of iran. he was overthrown by british and american interests because he threatened oil interests of the british. and as a result of that, the shah of iran came in, terrible dictator. the result of that, you had the iranian revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. unintended consequences. so

i have what i call the new college compact. because i think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know. number one, states have been dis-investing in higher education. in fact, i think new hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country. so states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education. so under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system. secondly, i don't believe in free tuition for everybody. i believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead. so i have proposed debt free tuition, which i think is affordable and i would move a lot of the pell grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense. so i put all of this together, again, on my website and i've gotten such a good response. but i want to quickly say, one of the areas that senator sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems. free college, a single payer system for health--and it's been estimated we're looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget. and i have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run. and i think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that i have proposed i will tell you exactly how i'm going to pay for it; including college.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.3964703381,0.1986667812,0.9880462885,-2.5279672146,1.1480280161,-0.717495203,0.2786614597,0.4504230917,-1.8789490461,0.8374289274,0.9926996231,1.8823378086,0.1535706967,-1.0781612396,1.9382730722,1.0487222672,-2.5365934372,4.5268301964,-0.8527393341,2.1592340469,-0.6766474247,-1.8279935122,-0.65512532,-0.8427140117,-0.2555101216,1.4298841953,-0.2834899426,2.0889041424,0.450307548,-1.1773775816,-0.3187730014,0.2533229589,0.0508986451,0.0353764929,-1.6590701342,-1.05128479,0.6545447707,-2.943038702,-1.8224966526,-4.0991988182,1.9664182663,1.8568148613,1.2698591948,-0.2817107141,-0.4383436143,-0.5300456882,0.1649874151,0.1414610445,-1.5928765535,-0.606978178,2.2023489475,-0.6705946326,-0.2018685639,-0.9641450644,0.819697082,-0.8573282361,1.5035386086,-0.0424608067,0.873758316,0.3392094076]},{"index":1631,"text":"well,

the real challenges with both donald and senator rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both hillary clinton and barack obama. so for example, in libya, both of them agreed with the obama\/clinton policy of toppling the government in libya. that was a disaster. it gave the country over to radical islamic terrorism and it endangered america. another example is john kerry. john kerry -- senator rubio voted to confirm john kerry as secretary of state. i voted against him. and donald trump supported john kerry against george w. bush in 2004, gave him a check. and john kerry has been the most anti-israel secretary of state this country has ever seen. his diplomacy has been a disaster. and if we nominate someone who agreed with john kerry, barack obama and hillary clinton

of eight bill, he would have liberalized immigration, but he did not -- and he steadfastly opposed any new border security requirements for refugees or students. last week, i introduced another bill saying we need more security, we need more scrutiny. once again, marco opposed this. so marco can't have it both ways. he thinks he wants to be this, \"oh, i'm great and strong on national defense.\" but he's the weakest of all the candidates on immigration. he is the one for an open border that is leaving us defenseless. if we want to defend the country, we have to defend against who's coming in, and marco is -- has more of an allegiance to chuck schumer and to the liberals than he does to conservative policy.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.8073291779,1.2896845341,-1.3410031796,2.3759818077,0.4938113391,-1.138731122,1.4832856655,-0.4768369794,2.7310369015,1.1948056221,-0.2864730954,0.2386846691,0.6613667011,-1.1761710644,1.3860598803,-0.7120500207,1.4878786802,1.0132092237,2.2272105217,0.0489052981,2.1648316383,-0.0682328939,-2.4453117847,-1.431329608,1.1733930111,2.4662818909,-1.0012059212,0.6174321771,-0.7869649529,0.3880796432,-0.366814822,0.3551962376,0.0442165695,0.5223431587,1.8820223808,1.2407666445,0.2058269233,-2.2919290066,-3.2083921432,1.3416535854,0.6613141298,-1.1062427759,2.9185509682,-0.2738022506,1.2863229513,0.3486655056,-0.9571340084,0.1614958495,-0.533628583,-1.1341503859,1.8565224409,-0.2254082859,-1.913126111,-0.8803976774,-3.0820922852,-0.0076404386,-2.712536335,-1.32875669,-0.0956244692,1.4655120373]},{"index":1678,"text":"well

you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. but let me just say this. in terms of where we are right now, as you mention, rachel, in a number of national and state, including new hampshire. for example, the last poll i saw -- there may have been a new one -- last one i saw here in new hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. there were also pretty large margins in iowa and wisconsin. these are polls. polls go up. polls go down. but here's why i think i will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process. republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. i believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout. if there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the white house, but i think we regain the senate. we win governors' chairs up and down the line. so i believe if you want to retain the white house, if you want to see democrats do well across the board, i think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.5130357742,0.5607192516,1.2821805477,-0.4499754012,1.6190690994,4.1771755219,0.0245074276,-1.3690005541,-0.7095533013,-0.4368216693,-0.3110352457,2.7909293175,-1.4225075245,-1.2209109068,-1.7940000296,-0.2207315564,1.2563576698,0.9263790846,2.5295763016,0.3491569459,-0.8216501474,-2.4388394356,1.9932227135,-0.4429531991,-1.2135512829,0.1212455034,1.0648173094,0.3923288286,0.5776126385,0.3867363334,1.6881817579,-1.2848986387,0.8371018171,-0.1048776284,-1.302236557,1.6121692657,3.8812558651,0.4888641536,-1.7682822943,2.5959093571,-0.0522795506,-0.092248179,-1.5519270897,0.0768804252,-0.4030814171,2.5999398232,-1.5880359411,-0.3935575187,-1.074724555,-0.9216887355,-0.9941990972,-0.0806926191,-0.0967010632,-0.8144966364,1.069396615,-1.0989376307,-0.1201934591,0.6278948188,1.1564753056,0.8348077536]},{"index":1796,"text":"well,
