"let me explain something. because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies -- because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are not mandated to bid properly, they have hundreds of billions of dollars in waste. we don't bid properly. we don't have proper bidding procedures. the reason we don't is because they take care of all of the senators, all of the congressman, and they don't bid. they don't go out to bid.",1
"yeah, i would go, first of all, one step further in this description of hillary clinton. she wouldn't just be a disaster, hillary clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the united states.",1
"and they love america. and as far as i know, no one on this stage has served in uniform in the united states military. anyone out there that has the uniform of the united states on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves america. no matter what their religious background may be.",1
"it means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why i have taken marijuana out of the controlled substance act. so that it will not be a federal crime.",0
"now, what i believe is in fact that we have a corrupt campaign finance system. and it's not just wall street, it's the drug companies, (inaudible) received millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry. we've got to overturn citizens united and end that.",0
"well, first of all, wolf, i said last february that we needed to have people on the ground, troops on the ground in a coalition similar to what we had in the first gulf war. i remember when the egyptian ambassador to the united states stood in the rose garden and pledged arab commitment to removing saddam hussein from kuwait. before we came out here tonight, i am told that the saudis have organized 34 countries who want to join in the battle against terrorism. first and foremost, we need to go and destroy isis. and we need to do this with our arab friends and our friends in europe. and when i see they have a climate conference over in paris, they should have been talking about destroying isis because they are involved in virtually every country, you know, across this world.",1
"look, i think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be. we have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in san bernardino and know that we haven't done enough. so we have to go after this both abroad and at home. we have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly isis -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute. we have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from isis. that is principally an american-led air campaign that we are now engaged in. we have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the arabs and the kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from raqqa to ramadi. we have to continue to work with the iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside iraq, like mosul, when they are able to do so. and we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters. and we have to take on isis online. they are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence. here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement. we need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed. but the final thing i want to say about this is the following. you know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in new york was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it. and we need to do that throughout the country. but we need to understand that american muslims are on the front line of our defense. they are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the american society. so when somebody like donald trump and",0
i'd like to finish my question -- my answer. and also we just bombed a hospital. we've had drone strikes that hit civilian weddings. so i would change how we -- our approach to the middle east. we need a new paradigm in the middle east.,0
"so david, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there. we actually took action to do these things and as president, i have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all american families. universal national service is an option for every kid in america to cut youth employment. and i'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for america's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great american cities and get them back to work.",0
"...but the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together. if we want free tuition at public colleges and universities, millions of young people are going to have to demand it, and give the republicans an offer they can't refuse. if we want to raise the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour, workers are going to have to come together and look the republicans in the eye, and say, ""we know what's going on. you vote against us, you are out of your job.""",0
"...others are also joining in making clear that his rhetoric, his demagoguery, his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system. especially from somebody running for president who couldn't decide whether or not to disavow the ku klux klan and david duke. so people can draw their own conclusions about him. i will just end by saying this. you don't make america great by getting rid of everything that made america great.",0
"i want to go back to the discussion we had a minute ago because, you know, what was said was right. the democrats are laughing -- because if republicans join democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose.",1
"well, first of all, let's remember where we were when bush left office. we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. and i know my republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue, but the world's financial crisis was on -- the world's financial markets system was on the verge of collapse. that's where we were. are we better off today than we were then? absolutely. but the truth is that for the 40 years, the great middle class of this country has been disappearing. and in my view what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; pay equity for women workers; and our disastrous trade policies, which have cost us millions of jobs; and make every public college and university in this country tuition free.",0
"well, let me say i think we did a great deal to help the libyan people after qadafi's demise. and here's what we did. we helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship. i was very proud of that. we got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that qadafi had, getting it out of libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups. we also worked to help them set up their government. we sent a lot of american experts there. we offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military. they, at the end, when it came to security issues, wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, european or other countries, in libya. and so we were caught in a very difficult position. they could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn't want to have others helping to provide that security. and the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country. and we can't walk away from that. we need to be working with european and arab partners...",0
"but more importantly, what is happening in flint to a lesser degree is happening throughout this country. in recent years we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires, and increase in income and wealth inequality, and all over this country middle class families are struggling. cities and towns are struggling, in order to provide basic services. among many other things, we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our water systems, our waste water plants, our roads and our bridges. the wealthiest country in the history of the world has got to get its priorities right, take care of the people, no more tax breaks for billionaires.",0
"well, look, i've got to just jump in here because, honestly, senator sanders is the only person who i think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment. and i've got to tell you that it",0
"the remark was made that there hadn't been anyone else on the podium opposed to the iraq war. i've made my career as being an opponent of the iraq war. i was opposed to the syria war. i was opposed to arming people who are our enemies. iran is now stronger because hussein is gone. hussein was the great bulwark and counterbalance to the iranians. so when we complain about the iranians, you need to remember that the iraq war made it worse. originally, governor bush was asked, was the iraq war a mistake, and he said, ""no. we'd do it again."" we have to learn sometimes the interventions backfire. the iraq war backfired and did not help us. we're still paying the repercussions of a bad decision.",1
"and i'll tell you what else. and i'll tell you what else i think. and that is, we have got -- and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as i understand it. we have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs. too many lives...",0
"well, bret, of course they have, and over the last six and a half years we've seen the consequences of the obama-clinton foreign policy. leading from behind is a disaster. we have abandoned and alienated our friends and allies, and our enemies are stronger. radical islam is on the rise, iran's on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon, china is waging cyber warfare against america, russia -- general soleimani, you just mentioned, the iranian general is the head of the al quds forces. he's directly responsible for the murder of over 500 american servicemen in iraq, and part of this iranian deal was lifting the international sanctions on general soleimani. the day general soleimani flew back from moscow to iran was the day we believed that russia used cyber warfare against the joint chiefs. we need a new commander in chief that will stand up to our enemies, and that will have credibility...",1

"you know, look. i feel a great deal of sympathy for the families of the four brave americans that we lost at benghazi. and i certainly can't even imagine the grief that she has for losing her son, but she's wrong. she's absolutely wrong. i and everybody in the administration, all the people she named, the president, the vice president, susan rice, we were scrambling to get information that was changing, literally by the hour. and when we had information, we made it public. but then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it. so i testified for 11 hours.",0
"well, i agree, you know? we can't sit up here -- i can't sit up here and make judgment over whether or not somebody committed a criminal act. but, i will tell you this that after an investigation, if people, in fact, were found to have committed a criminal act -- i talked to a mother. imagine this for a second, imagine a mother who had a bright seven-year-old gregarious girl doing well in school. two years later, that child is now in special education, intellectual capabilities significantly deteriorated. that is a crime against that child, and the people of flint. and, clearly, people are going to have to be held accountable.",0
"well first of all, i want people to think about what kind of leader do you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate. think about that. secondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands. these hands by the grace of god have saved many lives and healed many families. and i'm asking you tonight, america, to join hands with me to heal, inspire and revive america. if not us, who? and if not now, when?",1

"i hope i can get that kind of time here. as a president of the united states, every life in this country matters. at the same time, i believe i can say to you, i have had a long history of working with the situation of african americans. we're talking about criminal justice reform, i risked my political life raising the issue of criminal justice reform when i ran for the senate in virginia in 2006. i had democratic party political consultants telling me i was committing political suicide. we led that issue in the congress. we started a national debate on it. and it wasn't until then that the republican party started joining in. i also represented a so-called war criminal, an african american marine who was wounded -- who was convicted of murder in vietnam, for six years. he took his life three years into this. i cleared his name after -- after three years.",0
"i kind of have to laugh when i think of, ""mmm, sounds like a non sequitur."" he was asked whether or not he would be capable and it would be in good hands to be in charge of the nuclear weapons, and all of a sudden, there's a sideways attack at me. i think that really goes to really the judgment. do we want someone with that kind of character, that kind of careless language to be negotiating with putin? do we want someone like that to be negotiating with iran? i think really there's a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about mr. trump, but i am worried. i'm very concerned about him -- having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because i think his response, his -- his visceral response to attack people on their appearance -- short, tall, fat, ugly -- my goodness, that happened in junior high. are we not way above that? would we not all be worried to have someone like that in charge of the nuclear arsenal?",1
"no. but it is absolutely fair and necessary for americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average american family? in my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, i have been very specific about where i would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how i would move this agenda forward. i've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because i feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, gwen, that you are mentioning. there is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government. i'm aware of that. it comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum. so we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why i think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, i think, alienate americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.",0
"... if i could, you know, in the very first debate i was asked am i a moderate or a progressive and i said i'm a progressive who likes to get things done. cherry picking a quote here or there doesn't change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the children's defense fund. it certainly didn't stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies. before it was called hillarycare -- i mean, before it was called obamacare it was called hillarycare because we took them on, and we weren't successful, but we kept fighting and we got the children's health insurance program. every step along the way i have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it. so,",0

"absolutely, i agree. look, that bill had some sensible provisions in it. it had the banning of bullets that pierce policemen's armor. is that a good thing? i think we would want to get rid of that. particular legislation had safety locks on guns so the kids do not pick them up and shoot them. that bill had bad things in it. what i have said...",0
"and, maria, i will note, she's got a lot of experience, but her policies have proven disastrous. if you look at foreign policy, every region in the world has gotten worse. under her leadership, we abandon the nation of israel. under her leadership, radical islamic terrorism has been on to the rise. under her leadership, and obama's leadership, iran is getting $100 billion dollars, and on the verge of getting a nuclear weapon. everything she's put her hand to, or has touched -- and when we talk about the cronyism of washington, hillary clinton embodies the cronyism...",1
"all right. well, i'm trying to set a mark here so maybe we can get into a little more later on. this hasn't been equal time. but if you want to look at what has happened, if we look at the facts in terms of how we're going to deal with this, since that crash, in the last 10 years, the amount of the world's capital economy that wall street manages has gone from 44 percent to 55 percent. that means the wall street money managers are not risking themselves as the same way the american people are when they're going to get their compensation. they're managing money from all over the world. we have to take that into consideration when we're looking at ways to regulate it.",0
"in different forms. but i have great respect for the people i have met through this process. i've never done this process before. i've never been a politician. i mean, for the last six months i've been a politician. but i will tell you, i am totally committed to the republican party. i feel very honored to be the front runner.",1
"you know, i think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young americans. and i have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition. we differ, however, on a couple of key points. one of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go. and senator sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like scott walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. i am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.",0
"you know, at the end of the day, i'm going to continue to talk about my record, because there is, did you ever notice when people run for office, they run for president, they make a lot of promises, they don't keep them.",1
"no, it's the same policy. it will have to end at some moment, and as i said, we will -- we will eliminate that executive order. the people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it. and it's not because we're not compassionate to the plight of a 2 -- someone who came here when they were 2 years old. i understand. i know people that are personally impacted by this. the problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional. the president doesn't have the power to do that.",1
"i think the secretary and i mostly, i think, agree on this issue. look, in this country, immigration reform is a very hot debate. it's divided the country. but i would hope very much, that as we have that debate, we do not, as donald trump and others have done, resort to racism and xenophobia and bigotry.",0
"that's going to solve the problem. and, the insurance companies aren't going to say that, they want to keep it. they want to say -- they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is. i know the insurance companies, they're friends of mine. the top guys, they're friends of mine. i shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, i have a conflict of interest. they're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience. one of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling. he's not laughing so much anymore. hi.",1
"but i feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. that's target. they look around for gun-free zones. you know, we could give you another example -- the marines, the army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed. two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns. and somebody walked in and shot them, killed them. if they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long. i can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage. so, i think gun-free zones are a catastrophe. they're a feeding frenzy for sick people.",1
"i would not want to go to that point. i would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners. it doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after. there must be some way. i don't know enough about the technology, martha, to be able to say what it is, but i have a lot of confidence in our tech experts. and maybe the back door is the wrong door, and i understand what apple and others are saying about that. but i also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.",0
"six million more people are living in poverty than the day that barack obama got elected president. six million more people. the middle class has had declining income, workforce participation rates are lower than they were in 1977. for the first time in modern history, more businesses are failing than are being created. that is what the next president will have to deal with. and i believe we can reverse course by creating a strategy of high sustained economic growth, not the new normal of 2 percent that all the left says we just have to get used to, but a 4 percent growth strategy where we reform how we tax, fix the broken regulatory system, embrace the energy revolution in our midst, fix the immigration system so we can turn it into an economic driver, deal with the structural fiscal problems that exist because of our entitlement problems that will overwhelm and create way too much debt. if we grow at 4 percent, people are going to be lifted out of poverty. the great middle that defines our country will have a chance to be able to pursue their dreams as they see fit. that should be the great challenge and the great opportunity for the next president of the united states, to forge consensus to go back to a high-growth strategy. and then we'll be able to lead the world. without a high-growth strategy, our country will never have the resources or the optimism to be able to lead the world, which the world desperately needs our leadership.",1
"that's exactly what we saw. so look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility. when ceo income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth. and it's not the folks on wall street. i'm not anti-wall street, but i don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.",1
"well, you're right, the news is very disturbing that kim jong-un has put their nuclear weapons on ready state. i'm glad that we're sending another carrier group to the south china sea. i'm glad that congress passed sanctions on north korea. but this is all the result of the failures of the clinton administration two decades ago that negotiated a deal with north korea lifting the sanctions, allowing billions of dollars to flow in, and they used that money to develop nuclear weapons in the first place. what we -- now we're in a much harder position. when you have a lunatic with nuclear weapons, to some extent, it constrains your options. we need to be moving the carrier -- carrier group to the south china seas. we -- we need to be putting in place missile defense, such as the thaad missile defense system in south korea. we need to be pursuing space-based missile defense. one of the advantages of space-based missile defense is that if you have a missile launch in north korea or you have a missile launch in iran, a space-based missile defense can take out one or two or three missiles before it can cross over and do damage. and we also need to be putting pressure on china, because north korea is effectively a -- a client state of china. all of that will happen with a strong commander-in-chief that is devoted to keeping this country safe.",1
"i strongly support the president's executive actions. i hope the supreme court upholds them. i think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did. i am against the raids. i'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up. we should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country. i'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. have been ever since i was in the senate. i was one of the original sponsors of the dream act. i voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007. senator sanders voted against it at that time. because i think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. and as president i would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of congress that i thought i could persuade. hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country. and they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration",0
"it was a coalition made up of arabs and americans and westerners and we're going to need it again. and if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it. and that's just not acceptable. but i think a pause on syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of ohio.",1
"well, i think it's pretty clear that they know that i will. you have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super pac and they're advertising against me in iowa as we speak. so they clearly think i'm going to do what i say i will do and you can look at what i did in the senate. i did introduce legislation to reign in compensation. i looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena. and specifically said to wall street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down. i've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in wall street -- not just the big banks. that's a part of the problem and i am going right at them. i have a comprehensive, tough plan. but i went further than that. we have to go after what is called the shadow banking industry. those hedge funds. look at what happened in '08, aig, a big insurance company, lehman brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down. so, i want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.",0
"i was the grand marshall down 5th avenue a number of years ago for the israeli day parade, i have very close ties to israel. i've received the tree of life award and many of the greatest awards given by israel. as president, however, there's nothing that i would rather do to bring peace to israel and its neighbors generally. and i think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy. now, i may not be successful in doing it. it's probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind. ok? but it doesn't help if i start saying, ""i am very pro-israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage."" but it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because i would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for israel and for their neighbors. and i can't do that as well -- as a negotiator, i cannot do that as well if i'm taking big, big sides. with that being said, i am totally pro-israel.",1
"yes, well, roughly. let me say this. as a member of the health education committee that helped write the affordable care act, much of what secretary clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward. seventeen more million more people have health care. it is a step forward. a step forward. but this is what we also have to say. not only are deductibles rising, 29 million americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor. major crisis and primary health care. here is the bottom line. why is it that the united states of america today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right? why is it...",0
"good question, but i want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job. i've watched to see people say that we should dismantle medicare and medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold. i've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families. i've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today. we need somebody who can lead. we need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...",1
"well, thank you. this election, we have to decide the identity of america in the 2ist century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement. thirty-six years ago, ronald reagan and george h.w. bush began the reagan revolution. for a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense. but they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams. now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if we're simply going to become a party that preys on people's angers and fears. i hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that america will always be better in its future than it's been in its story history.",1
"anderson, no president -- no commander in chief -- should take the military option off the table, even if most of us would agree that it should be the last option. what disturbed people so much about -- and i would agree with senator sanders on this -- leading us into iraq under false pretenses and telling us, as a people, that there were weapons of mass destruction there was -- was one of the worst blunders in modern american history. but the reason why people remain angry about it is because people feel like a lot of our legislators got railroaded in a war fever and by polls. and i remember being at a dinner shortly before that invasion. people were talking at -- and saying, ""it'll take us just a couple years to rebuild democracy,"" and i thought, ""has this world gone mad?"" whenever we go -- and contrary to john quincy adams' advice -- ""searching the world for monsters to destroy,"" and when we use political might to take a -- at the expense of democratic principle, we hurt ourselves, and we hurt our (inaudible).",0

"i've actually been in politics all my life, although i've been on that side as opposed to this side. i'm now a politician for about three months. obviously, i'm doing pretty well. i'm number one in every poll by a lot. but the qualification is that i've dealt with people all over the world, been successful all over the world. everything i've done virtually has been a tremendous success. when markets changed, when things turned, i heard governor pataki, who, by the way, was a failed governor in new york, a very seriously failed -- he wouldn't be elected dog catcher right now. i heard what he had to say. and i will tell you this: atlantic city, i've made a tremendous amount of money in atlantic city. i left seven years ago, i've gotten great credit for my timing, and that's what i'm all about. i'm a businessman, did really well, really well, and jeb, what i want to do is put that ability into this country to make our country rich again. and i can do that, and i'm not sure that anybody else in the group will be able to do that.",1
"let me tell you this, mr. baker, in terms of the cyber attacks, we have the capability to not only have a defensive posture, but it also to make it clear to people that if you attack us with cyber attacks, we will destroy the mechanisms that you are using to attack us. i want to give you a little trip around the world. i served on the defense committee for 18 years. in the ukraine, arm the people there so they can fight for themselves. in the eastern part of europe, make sure that finland and the baltics know that if the russians move, we move. in syria, yes, a no-fly zone in the north on the turkish border, a no-fly zone on the south on the jordanian border. anybody flies in the first time, maybe they can fly out. they fly in there a second time, they will not fly out. and it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be. and it also sends many messages in the middle east that we're still involved. saudi arabia, cut off the funding for the radical clerics, the ones that preach against us. but they're fundamentally our friends. jordan, we want the king to reign for 1,000 years. egypt, they have been our ally and a moderating force in the middle east throughout their history. in the groups -- in the countries of the gulf states of bahrain, the cleveland clinic is opening an operation. clearly we see the same with them. and in israel, we have no better ally in the world, and no more criticizing them in public, we should support them. and finally china, china doesn't own the south china sea, and i give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more. and in the trade agreement, the tpp, it's critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the chinese. they are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend. and finally, i will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics. when the fall comes, and we run against hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected. i have two 16-year-old girls, and i want this country to be strong. we make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble. we must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid. i served in washington as the chairman of the budget committee, and we got the budget balanced. and in ohio, as the ceo, and guess what, we have got to have a ceo mentality and a way to beat hillary clinton and the democracies in the fall. and our ideas have to add up. they have to be solid. and people have to know we have the confidence to lead america. and as president, i will lead this country, as i have before in washington and in ohio, and will return both on domestic and international affairs. and i appreciate the opportunity to speak this time, gerry.",1
"let me -- let me answer your question on the sun-sentinel editorial today. back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the senate by the name of bob graham, a democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. i don't recall them calling for his resignation --",1
"well, i'm sorry i didn't answer that part. so the thing is that my -- my generation, someone my age would retire at 68. we would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. and so my children would retire at 70. i would retire at 68. it would be a graduating scale over a period of time. but again i'm talking about people like myself and ted who are 45 years old. we're years away from retirement. for people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all. if we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis. it's not a question of if. it is a question of when. in less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on medicare, medicaid, the interest on the debt. that's -- all of it will be eaten up by that. that's a debt crisis. and it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis.",1
"you know, i find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations. the fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before. not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. and, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. and we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid. i mean, just think about a scenario like that. they explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. they hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs. can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? he needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us. but here's the real key. we have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it. and the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.",1
"well, i think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid. some of the bravest people that i had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in iraq, in afghanistan, elsewhere. so, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome. these are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.",0
"i am not a pacifist, anderson. i supported the war in afghanistan. i supported president clinton's effort to deal with ethnic cleansing in kosovo. i support air strikes in syria and what the president is trying to do. yes, i happen to believe from the bottom of my heart that war should be the last resort that we have got to exercise diplomacy. but yes, i am prepared to take this country into war if that is necessary.",0
"...responding. all right? when this campaign began, i said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. secretary clinton said let's raise it to $12. there's a difference. and, by the way, what has happened is history has outpaced secretary clinton, because all over this country, people are standing up and they're saying $12 is not good enough, we need $15 an hour.",0
"yeah, you can, because african-americans and latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. so, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. but it is a general economic issue. and here's what the economic issue is. the wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. why is that? because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate america through nafta and permanent normal trade relations with china, secretary clinton and i disagree on those issues. but view is those trade policies have enabled corporate america to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. but you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits. you once had a pension. those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. they're off to china. now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone. what have you got now? you are working at mcdonald's? that is why there is massive despair all over this country. people have worked their entire lives. they're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all. and that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down. suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.",0
"yes, and it was the same one that president obama made. because i don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes. we just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001. since, you know, the end of the last clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody. and we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and i don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.",0

"well, first of all, we need to destroy isis in the caliphate. that's -- that should be our objective. the refugee issue will be solved if we destroy isis there, which means we need to have a no-fly zone, safe zones there for refugees and to build a military force. we need to embed our forces -- our troops inside the iraqi military. we need to arm directly the kurds. and all of that has to be done in concert with the arab nations. and if we're going to ban all muslims, how are we going to get them to be part of a coalition to destroy isis? the kurds are the greatest fighting force and our strongest allies. they're muslim. look, this is not a serious proposal. in fact, it will push the muslim world, the arab world away from us at a time when we need to reengage with them to be able to create a strategy to destroy isis. so donald, you know, is great at -- at the one-liners, but he's a chaos candidate. and he'd be a chaos president. he would not be the commander in chief we need to keep our country safe.",1
"but here is a good point. you know, in virtually all of the general election match-up polls between trump and secretary clinton and trump and bernie sanders, in almost all of those polls, i do better than secretary clinton both in the cnn poll i was 20 points ahead of trump. i think secretary clinton was 12 points. and you know why? because in fact a whole lot of people -- this may be a shock to the secretary, but there a whole lot of independents in this country.",0
"yes, i do. and -- you know, what i hope the supreme court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line. i have much more confidence in the federal system, and i do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism. i have strong feelings about that. i thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that timothy mcveigh received the death penalty for blowing up the federal building in oklahoma city, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center. i do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but i deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it. if it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the supreme court, that would, i think, be an appropriate outcome.",0

"...numerically, it's gonna be higher. but the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families. we are lowering taxes on small business. you know, a lot of business activity in america is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning. he's an s corporation. he pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate. under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income. that is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.",1
"i'd like first to respond to the acquisition, we should -- i think it's particularly naive, particularly foolish to think that we're not going to talk to russia. the idea of a no fly zone, realize that this is also something that hillary clinton agrees with several on our side with, you're asking for a no fly zone in an area in which russia already flies. russia flies in that zone at the invitation of iraq. i'm not saying it's a good thing, but you better know at least what we're getting into. so, when you think it's going to be a good idea to have a no fly zone over iraq, realize that means you are saying we are going to shoot down russian planes. if you're ready for that, be ready to send your sons and daughters to another war in iraq. i don't want to see that happen. i think the first war in iraq was a mistake...",1

"first of all, we could get to 4 percent growth. the new normal of 2 percent puts huge demands on government. the reason why we have structural deficits is that more and more people are relying on government and the growth that we don't have makes -- makes the deficit grow. a 4 percent growth strategy starts with tax reform. and the proposal that i've laid out is the one the wall street journal editorial board has said is the most pro-growth of all the proposals out there. we cut the -- we eliminate a lot of deductions and cut the rates down. a corporate rate of 20 percent, which puts us 5 percent above -- below that of china, and allows us full expensing of investing. it would create an explosion of investment back into this country, creating higher-wage jobs, and so that's part of it. on the regulatory side i think we need to repeal every rule that barack obama has in terms of work in progress, every one of them.",1

"...measured in an intellectually honest way, with abundant school choice, ending social promotion. and i know how to do this because as governor of the state of florida i created the first statewide voucher program in the country, the second statewide voucher program, in the country and the third statewide voucher program in the country. and we had rising student achievement across the board, because high standards, robust accountability, ending social promotion in third grade, real school choice across the board, challenging the teachers union and beating them is the way to go. and florida's low income kids had the greatest gains inside the country. our graduation rate improved by 50 percent. that's what i'm for.",1

"martha, thank you. i want to thank all of the people who have tuned in tonight. i want to thank the great people of new hampshire, where despite all of the cynicism about big money and big banks taking over our politics, here in new hampshire, the individual matters. you know, my wife katie and i have four terrific kids, and like you, there's probably nothing we wouldn't do to give them a future that's safer, that's healthier, where they have more opportunity than our parents and grandparents gave to us. tonight, what you listened to was a healthy exchange of ideas about how we'd do that, that which we have always proven, the capacity to do better than any nation in the world, to take actions that include more of our people more fully in the economic, social and political life of our country. when you listened to the republican debate the other night, you heard a lot of anger and you had a lot of fear. well, they can have their anger and they can have their fear, but anger and fear never built america. we build our country by adopting wage and labor policies, including comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway of citizenship for all. we do it by investing in our country, by investing in infrastructure, by investing in the skills and the talents of our people with debt-free college, and we can do it again. and we also create a better future for our kids when we square our shoulders to the great challenges of our times, whether it's terror trying to undermine our values or republican presidential candidates trying to get us to surrender our freedoms and our values in the face of this threat. the other big challenge we have is climate change. the greatest business opportunity to come to the united states of america in 100 years. we need to embrace this. i have put forward a plan that does this, that moves us to 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050. join this campaign for the future. new leadership is what our country needs to move us out of these divided and polarized times. thank you.",0
"well, look, all i'm in favor of in ohio is high standards. first of all, let me tell you, i would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states. ok, i've been working on this for many, many years. secondly, jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards. and we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately. they set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum. not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. and we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state. now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st century and what we need to do with our kids? we need to start connecting them to the real world. we need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st century, not the jobs of 20 years ago. we need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their k through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs. frankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their god-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion. and that's exactly what we're doing in ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be. so let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards. that's what it is in the state of ohio.",1

"because -- and i don't know if donald realizes this. i'm sure it's not his intent perhaps. but the position you've taken is an anti-israel position. and here's why. because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith. the palestinian authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the israels. instead, here's what the palestinians do. they teach their four- year-old children that killing jews is a glorious thing. here's what hamas does. they launch rockets and terrorist attacks again israel on an ongoing basis. the bottom line is, a deal between israel and the palestinians, given the current makeup of the palestinians, is not possible. and so the next president of the united states needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of israel. i'm not -- i'm not going to sit here and say, ""oh, i'm not on either side."" i will be on a side. i will be on israel's side every single day because they are the only pro-american, free enterprise democracy in the entire middle east.",1
"well, i think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of syria and iraq. and i will do my very best to make sure that that doesn't happen. i agree with the secretary that i think what has to happen -- and let me just mention what king abdullah of jordan said. i think he hit the nail on the head. and what he said is essentially the war against isis is a war for the soul of islam. and it must be muslim troops on the ground that will destroy isis, with the support of a coalition of major powers -- u.s., u.k., france, germany and russia. so our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate. but at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that isis would like american combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the muslim world and say, ""look, we're taking on those terrible americans."" the combat on the ground must be done by muslim troops with our support. we must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the middle east.",0

"well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out. if you look at dwight eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left. self-deportation, as i really define it, and that's the way i define it, is you're going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out. as far as the people that i've hired in various parts of florida during the absolute prime season, like palm beach and other locations, you could not get help. it's the up season. people didn't want to have part-time jobs. there were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn't get. everybody agrees with me on that. they were part-time jobs. you needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of florida.",1

"and that is -- that is exactly what i want to do as your president. we will celebrate our diversity. we will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for america. that's what i'm offering in this campaign, to build on the work, to build on the value that we share here in new york, to take those to washington, and to knock down those barriers that in any way hold back not only individual americans, bur our country from reaching our full potential. that is what my campaign is about.",0

"and we are going to do a political revolution, which brings working people, young people, senior citizens, minorities together. because every issue that i am talking about-- paid family and medical leave, breaking up the banks on wall street, asking the wealth to pay their fair share of taxes, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour -- every one of those issues is supported by a significant majority of the american people. the problem is, that as a result of a corrupt campaign finance system, congress is not listening to the american people. its listening to the big money interest. what the political revolution is about is bringing people together to finally say, enough is enough. this government belongs to us. not just the billionaires.",0
"you know, first of all -- first of all, there isn't an issue. when i was in public service serving as the senator from new york, i did stand up to the banks. i did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused. i'm the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as senator sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with lehman brothers. now, if you're going to look at the problems that actually caused the great recession, you've got to look at the whole picture. it was a giant insurance company, aig. it was an investment bank, lehman brothers. it was mortgage companies like countrywide. i'm not saying that senator sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives...",0

"first of all, let me just say that, in the state of ohio -- and i'm the only acting executive on -- on this stage today -- we do have a moderate increase in the minimum wage. and i got to tell you, my father carried mail on his back. his father was a coal miner. he died of black lung. he was losing his eyesight. my mother's mother lived with us. she could barely speak english. i come from a town where if the wind blew the wrong way, people found themselves out of work. an economic theory is fine, but you know what? people need help. now, i have a plan that, in fact, would cut taxes, but not $11 trillion or $12 trillion that would put my children further in debt. i have a plan that would not only cut taxes, lower the income tax rate for individuals, lower the tax for businesses so businesses will compete here and not move operations overseas, and also a plan -- the only plan of anybody standing on this stage to get us to a balanced budget by the end of a second term. and, you know, the simple fact of the matter is, we hear a lot of promises in this debate, a lot of promises about these tax cuts or tax schemes sometimes that i call them. hillary and the democrats promise everything on the spending side. we've got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side. yes, lower taxes, lower spending. my website, johnkasich.com, will show you exactly how we balance the budget. i balanced the budget in washington as a chief architect, and i have balanced it in ohio for one reason. when you balance the budget and you cut taxes, people get work. and our most important moral purpose as leaders in the political system is to make sure we create an environment for job creation so people can live their dreams and realize their god-given potential. that's why it's so important. and for those at the bottom, we've got to do what we can to train them so they can move up. but to just look the other way is not acceptable, because, you know what, as the governor of ohio i have to deal with real challenges, and we've gotten it done in our state, and i will do it for america.",1

"well, listen. you know, if we want to deal with these issues, we have to deal with them in a way that makes sense. i agree with what dr. carson said earlier. the first thing we need to do to make america stronger is to strengthen our military, and i put out a really specific plan: no less than 500,000 active duty soldiers in the army. no less than 185,000 active duty marines in the marine corps. bring us to a 350 ship navy again, and modernize the ohio class of submarines, and bring our air force back to 2,600 aircraft that are ready to go. those are the kind of things that are going to send a clear message around the world. those are the things that we need to start working on immediately to make our country stronger and make it better. those are the things that we need to be able to be doing. and as we move towards dealing with foreign aid, i don't disagree with senator paul's position that we shouldn't be funding our enemies. but i absolutely believe that israel is a priority to be able to fund and keep them strong and safe after eight years of this administration.",1
"well thanks for the question and congratulations on five million viewers on youtube, that's quite an accomplishment. look, this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people. i've laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable; how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars, how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that i talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing. so making community college free, making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition, looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted republican assault; on voting rights, on women's rights, on gay rights, on civil rights, on workers rights. and i know how much young people value their independence, their autonomy, and their rights. so i think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how we're going to encourage even more american's to vote because it absolutely clear to me...",0

"i am -- will absolutely admit that secretary clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the house. she has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her. that's a fact. i don't deny it. but i am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece. that we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out. that our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people. so, rachel, yes, secretary clinton does represent the establishment. i represent, i hope, ordinary americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but i am very proud to have people like keith ellison and raul grijalva in the house, the co-chairmen of the house progressive caucus.",0

"i'm in favor of people coming into this country legally. and you know what? they can have it anyway you want. you can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want. i've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks i really like a lot -- but i'm the only one that can say that. i have created tens of thousands of jobs, and i'll be creating many millions of jobs if i'm given -- if i'm given the opportunity to be president. as far as mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine. they have to come into this country legally. we have a country of borders. we have a country of laws. we have to obey the laws. it's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.",1
"well, first of all, let me say that you're right, there are about 3 million seniors in florida with social security and medicare. one of them is my mother, who happens to be here today. i'm against any changes to social security that are bad for my mother. and we don't have to make any changes for them. but anyone who tells you that social security can stay the way it is is lying. any politician that goes around saying, ""we don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,"" they're not being honest with you. social security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. so what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our social security is going to work differently than it did for my parents. for example, instead of retiring at 67 the way i'm supposed to retire, i'd have to retire at 68. if i were still in the senate, i'd be one of the youngest people there.",1

"well, actually, i have been very consistent. over the course of my entire life, i have always fought for the same values and principles, but, like most human beings -- including those of us who run for office -- i do absorb new information. i do look at what's happening in the world. you know, take the trade deal. i did say, when i was secretary of state, three years ago, that i hoped it would be the gold standard. it was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards. my standards for more new, good jobs for americans, for raising wages for americans. and i want to make sure that i can look into the eyes of any middle-class american and say, ""this will help raise your wages."" and i concluded i could not.",0
"now let me get back to what happened in january of 2009. the bush administration negotiated the deal. were there things in it that i didn't like? would i have done it differently? absolutely. but was the auto bailout money in it -- the $350 billion that was needed to begin the restructuring of the auto industry? yes, it was. so when i talk about senator sanders being a one-issue candidate, i mean very clearly -- you have to make hard choices when you're in positions of responsibility. the two senators from michigan stood on the floor and said, ""we have to get this money released."" i went with them, and i went with barack obama. you did not. if everybody had voted the way he did, i believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking four million jobs with it.",0
"one of the things that made ronald reagan a great president, is that he understood that america was a unique nation, like any other that had existed throughout human history. he knew it was founded on universal principles that were powerful, the dignity of all people, human rights, the rights of all to live in freedom and liberty, and choose their own path in life. he didn't just believe it, he acted on it. that's why bringing down communism was so important to him. if i'm honored with the opportunity to be president, i hope that our air force one will fly, first and foremost, to our allies; in israel, in south korea, and japan. they know we stand with them. that america can be counted on. it would also fly to china, not just to meet with our enemies, not just to meet with those adversaries of ours that are there, but also to meet with those that aspire to freedom and liberty within china. i would even invite them to my inauguration. we would also fly into moscow and into russia. and not just meet with the leaders of russia, but also meet with those who aspire to freedom and liberty in russia. and ultimately, i hope that my air force one, if i become president, will one day land in a free cuba, where its people can choose its leaders and its own destiny.",1

"this is why i go back to that 2007 vote because if we had been successful then, a lot of the issues we are still discussing today would be in the rear-view mirror. i want us to be able to achieve comprehensive immigration reform if i'm so fortunate enough to be president. and we do have to take a look at asylum laws. when i was secretary of state, i worked to try to support many different approaches to ending the violence in central america. i was there meeting with leaders, security leaders, and others. and i think the congress should support the president's request to fund programs that would protect people and change the culture of criminality and violence in central america, helping people be able to stay safely in their homes and countries.",0

"and as far as israel is concerned, you know, when i was there several months ago, i talked to a lot of people. i couldn't find a single one who didn't think that we had turned our backs on israel. you know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a judeo christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject israel. it doesn't mean that we can't be fair to other people. we can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it's like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child. and now, as far as north korea is concerned, you know, kim jung un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength. and i think we have to present strength to him. we should be encouraging the alliance with japan and south korea. we should be encouraging the placement of the thaad, the terminal high-altitude area defense, that seems to disturb not only the north koreans but the chinese as well. and we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and i think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities. we need to be able to defend ourselves. and lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.",1
"if i understand -- and -- you know, as i understand it, what you're really talking about is not what secretary clinton is responding to. as i understand it -- and maybe i'm wrong on this, but what you were essentially saying, and what people are saying, is that, if somebody who is crazy or a criminal or a horrible person goes around shooting people, the manufacturer of that gun should be held liable. and if that is your position, then what you are saying, essentially -- if that is the case, as i understand it -- it's not what secretary clinton is talking about. i agree with what she said. but if that is the case, then essentially, your position is there should not be any guns in america, period.",0
the party left me. there's no doubt about that. there was no room for a liberal moderate republican in that party. i even had a primary for my reelection in 2006. i won it. but the money poured in to defeat me in rhode island as a republican. that's what we were up against.,0
"well, first of all, and before we do anything, i've been abundantly clear on this. when i'm president of the united states, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border. and, that's not just the physical border with mexico, it's visa overstays. that's 45 percent of the problem right there. it also has to do -- that's why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth. and, until that happens, we're not doing anything else. and then we'll see what the american people are willing to support. and donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate. well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that he's now taking are new to him. in 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship. in 2012, donald criticized mitt romney, saying that mitt lost his election because of self-deportation. and so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that donald, you've hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that americans could have filled. my mom and dad -- my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an american like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead. so i think this is an important issue. and i think we are realizing increasingly that it's an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.",1
"and, it is not good enough. you know, if we, god forbid, were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it. that was what 9/11 was about. we have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances. there's going to be international conflict.",0
"but during that same period, '96. there was a bill called -- so-called, it had a long title to it, welfare reform bill. and this bill really was a bill that scapegoated the poorest people in this country. i strongly opposed that legislation. secretary clinton had a different position then. and what that legislation ended up doing is increasing extreme poverty, the poorest people in this country have become much poorer as a result of that -- really a bill that was written by republicans. bad bill.",0
"your story is for -- voting for every disastrous trade agreement, and voting for corporate america. did i vote against the wall street bailout? when billionaires on wall street destroyed this economy, they went to congress and they said, ""please, we'll be good boys, bail us out."" you know what i said? i said, ""let the billionaires themselves bail out wall street."" it shouldn't be the middle class of this country.",0
"now maria, listen. i said right from the beginning that we should take no syrian refugees of any kind. and the reason i said that is because the fbi director told the american people, told congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe. that's the end of the conversation. i can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue. here's the way you need to deal with it. you can't just ban all muslims. you have to ban radical islamic jihadists. you have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us. the only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep america safe.",1
"but this is my time. i want to go back to this question you asked about the debt. this is an important issue. it's a huge issue, ok? in less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of social security, medicare, medicaid, and the interest on the debt. that means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the department of education or environmental protection issues. you cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why i've been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the senate in florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on social security and medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations. and i think if we -- the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis. and, wolf, you did not get an answer to your question. this debt issue is -- the next president of the united states will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt. it is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis. and we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.",1
"no. revolution never came. i waited and i got the scars to show for it. we now have this great accomplishment known as the affordable care act, and i don't think we should have to be defending it among democrats. we ought to be working to improve it and prevent republicans from both underming it and even repealing it. i have looked at -- i have looked at the legislation that senator sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the affordable care act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates medicare, eliminates medicaid, tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer. and i have to tell you, i would not want -- if i lived in iowa, terry branstad administering my health care. i -- i think -- i think as democrats we ought to proudly support the affordable care act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.",0
"i just said that. he said at the naacp that there were some aspects that worked well. the violence against women provisions have worked well, for example. but, other aspects of it were a mistake and i agree. that's why i'm focused, and have a very comprehensive approach toward fixing the criminal justice system, going after systemic racism that stalks the criminal justice system, ending private prisons, ending the incarceration of low-level offenders, and i am committed to doing that.",0
"jake, let me be clear what donald just said. he said that that 45 percent tax is a threat. and mind you, you are paying the tax. it's not china that pays the tax. it's you, the working men and women. so ask yourself at home: how is this helping you? if your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can't pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, ""i'm going to jack -- i'm going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing."" that hurts you. it's why we've got to get beyond rhetoric of china bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem. because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in america.",1
"well, jake, i was named u.s. attorney by president bush on september 10th, 2001. and that next day my wife mary pat did what she did every day, she traveled through the world trade center and went to her office two blocks from the world trade center. and after those planes hit, for five-and-a-half-hours after that, i couldn't reach her, didn't know whether she was dead or alive, and we had three children at the time, 8, 5 and 1. and i had to confront what so many thousands of others in my region had to confront, the idea i might become a single parent, the idea that my life and my children's life might be changed forever. we lost friends that day. we went to the funerals. and i will tell you that what those people wanted and what they deserved was for america to answer back against what had been done to them. and i support what president bush did at that time, going into afghanistan, hunting al qaeda and its leaders, getting its sanctuary out of place, and making it as difficult around the world for them to move people and money. and then he went to prosecutors like us, and he said, never again. don't prosecute these people after the crime is committed. intervene before the crime happens. i absolutely believe that what the president did at the time was right. and i am proud to have been one of the people on the stage who was part of making sure that what governor bush said before was the truth. america was safe for those seven years and barack obama has taken that safety away from us.",1
"well, first of all, let me say what i actually said about raising the minimum wage. i was asked should it be raised, i said, probably, or possibly. but, what i added, which i think is the most important thing, so, i said we need to get both sides of this issue to sit down, and talk about it. negotiate a reasonable minimum wage, and index that so that we never have to have this conversation again in the history of america. i think we also have to have two minimum wages, a starter, and a sustaining because how are young people ever going to get a job if you have such a high minimum wage that it makes it impractical to hire them...",1

"first let me say, we have just spent a good bit of time discussing, as republicans, how to solve this problem. i would ask your audience at home to ask a very basic question. why have democrats not solved this problem? president obama campaigned in 2007 and 2008 on solving the immigration problem. he entered washington with majorities in the house and the senate. he could have chosen to do anything to solve this pro -- this problem. instead, he chose to do nothing. why? because the democrats don't want this issue solved.",1
"well, there's no question. they were saying that the israelis intended to go to the dome of the rock. and i mean, when you think about this, thank goodness we work with israelis to give them the iron dome where they can protect themselves against all the missiles that were flying in. could you imagine living in like miami here and having people shooting missiles in? secondly, there was just an article the other day, hugh, that i know you're familiar with the israelis are learning to train underground in combat because the palestinians now, hamas in particular, is digging these tunnels trying to get under israel. they're coming at them from above, they're trying to come at them under the ground. and i just have to tell you this, i don't believe there is any long-term permanent peace solution. and i think pursuing that is the wrong thing to do. i believe that every day that we can stability in that region by supporting the israelis and making sure they have the weapons and the security that they need with our 100 percent backing is the way to proceed in the middle east in regard to israel.",1

"no. i don't think we're any safer -- i do not think we are any safer from bankruptcy court. as we go further, and further into debt, we become less, and less safe. this is the most important thing we're going to talk about tonight. can you be a conservative, and be liberal on military spending? can you be for unlimited military spending, and say, oh, i'm going to make the country safe? no, we need a safe country, but, you know, we spend more on our military than the next ten countries combined? i want a strong national defense, but i don't want us to be bankrupt.",1
"here is the one thing i'm not going to do. i'm not going to have something that ted described in his tax plan. it's called the value added tax. and it's a tax you find in many companies in europe. where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees. and that's why they have it in europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what ronald reagan said. ronald regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them. now, you can support one now that's very low. but what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that vat tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors. because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job. and therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees. when i am president of the united states, i'm going to side with ronald regan on this and not nancy pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.",1
"i think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect. historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react. i plead that it's very difficult when you deal with isis and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.",0

"marco still misunderstands the immigration issue. what i put forward was an amendment that would have temporarily halted immigration from high-risk terrorist countries, but would have started it up, but i wanted them to go through global entry, which is a program where we do background checks. the thing is, is that every terrorist attack we've had since 9/11 has been legal immigration. marco wants to expand that. i want more rules, more scrutiny, and to defend the country, you have to defend the border.",1
"you know, everyone here talks about the need to take on washington. the natural next question is who actually has done so. who actually has stood up not just to democrats, but to leaders in our own party? when millions of americans rose up against obamacare, i was proud to lead that fight. when millions of americans rose up against amnesty, i was proud to lead that fight. when millions of americans rose up against planned parenthood, i was proud to lead that fight. if people are promising they're going to take on washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it. in my family, my dad fled oppression in cuba to come to america. freedom is personal for me, and i will always keep my word and fight for freedom.",1

"most of the people who want to the no-fly zone also favored arming the allies of al qaeda, which became isis. that was the dumbest, most foolhardy notion. and most of the people up here supported it. they wanted to arm the allies of al qaeda. some of them still do. that's how isis grew. we pushed back assad, and isis was allowed to grow in the vacuum. so the first thing you do is don't arm your enemies.",1

"well, first of all, i think, as we've seen throughout this campaign, donald has not shown a seriousness about the issues of foreign policy. he just simply hasn't. whether it was the structure of our military, even today he was asked a question about the issue of commanders not following his lead on killing the family of terrorists. and his answer basically was, if i tell them to do it, they're going to do it. now that's just not true. foreign policy is not only consequential, i think much of our future now depends on it. you know, i see a lot of young people at my events around the country. i feel great when they come. and i always them that despite the hardships of the moment, i honestly believe that today's millennials have a chance to be the greatest generation we've had in 100 years. i really do. because the world today has hundreds of millions of people that can afford to be their clients, their customers, their partners, people they collaborate with. but that won't happen if the world is dangerous and it's unstable. and that will require strong american leadership. the next president of the united states is going to have eight years of a mess of a foreign policy to clean up. that's why it can't be hillary clinton. and quite frankly, that's why it can't be someone who simply has not shown the intellectual curiosity or the interest in learning about these very complicated issues. and donald simply hasn't.",1

"well, i definitely believe that he is unstable, and i do, in fact, believe that china has a lot more influence with him than we do. but we also recognize that north korea is in severe financial straits, and they have decided to use their resources to build their military, rather than to feed their people and to take care of the various humanitarian responsibilities that they have. we can capitalize upon that. you know, we should use our economic power in lots of different ways. i think we can use that in order to keep putin contained, because he is a one-horse show. energy. and we have an abundance of energy, but we have archaic energy exportation rules. we need to get rid of those, allow ourselves to really make europe dependent on us and other parts of the world dependent on us for energy. put him back in his little box where he belongs. and, you know, we need to be doing lots of other things with the resources that we have. so economic power works just as well as military power, perhaps even better. and speaking of that, our military needs to be upgraded. you know, you look at things like our ohio class submarines, they're 25 years old. our minuteman 3 missiles -- they are 34 years old. our b-52 bombers -- 50 years old. you know, if we don't get the military right nothing else matters.",1

"we have to be much tougher. we have to be much stronger than we've been. we have people that know what is going on. you take a look at just the attack in california the other day. there were numerous people, including the mother, that knew what was going on. they saw a pipe bomb sitting all over the floor. they saw ammunition all over the place. they knew exactly what was going on. when you had the world trade center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back, for the most part, to saudi arabia. they knew what was going on. they went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television. i would be very, very firm with families. frankly, that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families' lives.",1

"small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and we're not creating and growing small businesses. i think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces -- because that's the way congress is set up. you go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning. immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure -- we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that i want to see for our country.",0
"no. i think that we have the opportunity through the states that are pursuing recreational marijuana to find out a lot more than we know today. i do support the use of medical marijuana, and i think even there we need to do a lot more research so that we know exactly how we're going to help people for whom medical marijuana provides relief. so, i think we're just at the beginning, but i agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana. therefore, we need more states, cities, and the federal government to begin to address this so that we don't have this terrible result that senator sanders was talking about where we have a huge population in our prisons for nonviolent, low-level offenses that are primarily due to marijuana.",0
"yes, let me -- three points of distinction. the first is, if you're an american citizen and you decide to join up with isis, we're not going to read you your miranda rights. you're going to be treated as an enemy combatant, a member of an army attacking this country.",1
"you know, i think mr. trump is a wonderful entertainer. he's been terrific at that business. i also think that one of the benefits of a presidential campaign is the character and capability, judgment and temperament of every single one of us is revealed over time and under pressure. all of us will be revealed over time and under pressure. i look forward to a long race.",1
"well, john, look, i think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that george w. bush made with the iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend iraq. unfortunately, nouri al-maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it. and then, with the revolution against assad -- and i did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with assad because i thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum. so, yes, this has developed. i think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but i don't think that the united states has the bulk of the responsibility. i really put that on assad and on the iraqis and on the region itself.",0
"on the issue of barack obama, barack obama does not believe that america is a great global power. barack obama believes that america is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. and that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like iran and we betray our allies like israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for america. he doesn't understand the threat in isis. he consistently underestimates it but i do not. there is a war against isis, not just against isis but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win. when i'm president of the united states, we are going to win this war on isis. the most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. and if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to guantanamo bay, cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.",1
"later that year, in 2004, john kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. i don't recall the sun -- in fact, the sun-sentinel endorsed him. in 2008, barack obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again. so this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.",1
"and let me point out, you know, it is easy for political candidates to have rhetoric and say, ""i support the second amendment."" but you cannot say that and at the same time say what donald just said, which is that on the question of supreme court nominees he wants to compromise and reach a middle ground with harry reid and chuck schumer. that's what he said in the last debate.",1
"well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally. u.s. citizens can come back. that's existing law. but let me say, wolf, i really find it amazing that donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. i can tell you, when i ran for senate here in the state of texas, i ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall. and in 2013, when i was fight against the ""gang of eight"" amnesty bill, where was donald? he was firing dennis rodman on ""celebrity apprentice.""",1
"well, first karen, obviously it's painful for me to hear that. and i do take responsibility. when you're in public life, even if you believe that it's not an opinion that you think is fair or founded, you do have to take responsibility. and i do. and i also have, you know, very much committed to the best of my ability my energies and efforts to helping people. that's something that i care deeply about. and i will continue to do that, to demonstrate by my past actions and my present levels of commitment and plans that people can count on me. that is certainly what happened to me in new york, where people got to know me. they saw me in action. and they did. look, i have said before and it won't surprise anybody to hear me say it, this is not easy for me. it's not easy to do what i think is right, to help people, to even the odds, to hear a story like the woman's story we just heard. and to know that i can make a difference and i want to in every way possible. i am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or president obama. so i have a view that i just have to do the best i can, get the results i can, make a difference in people's lives, and hope that people see that i'm fighting for them and that i can improve conditions economically and other ways that will benefit them and their families.",0
"look, he mentioned me. i can bring -- i can talk. this is -- this is the problem. banning all muslims will make it harder for us to do exactly what we need to do, which is to destroy isis. we need a strategy. we need to get the lawyers off the back of the warfighters. right now under president obama, we've created this -- this standard that is so high that it's impossible to be successful in fighting isis. we need to engage with the arab world to make this happen. it is not a serious proposal to say that -- to the people that you're asking for their support that they can't even come to the country to even engage in a dialogue with us. that's not a serious proposal. we need a serious leader to deal with this. and i believe i'm that guy.",1
"secretary clinton, i do have a disagreement here. if my memory is correct, i think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, i thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country. that was not, as i understand it, the secretary's position. in terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, i did vote against it. i voted against it because the southern poverty law center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery. akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country. so it wasn't just me who opposed it. it was lulac, one of the large latino organizations in this country. it was the afl-cio. it was some of the most progressive members of the united states congress who opposed it for that reason. but we are where we are right now. and where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up. what we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.",0
"well, i would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed. a flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others. you know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money. you know, i -- my -- my mother taught me this. you know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar. i mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car. in fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.",1
"well, jake, you know, i'm -- i'm very glad that donald trump's being in this race has forced the mainstream media finally to talk about illegal immigration. i think that's very important. i like and respect ben carson. i'll let him talk about his own plans. but i will say this: the natural next question that primary voters are asking, after we focus on illegal immigration is, okay, what are the records of the various candidates? and this is an issue on which there are stark differences. a majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty. i am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty and, in fact, who helped lead the fight to stop a massive amnesty plan. in 2013, when barack obama and harry reid joined the washington republicans in a massive, i stood shoulder to shoulder with jeff sessions helping lead the fight. you know, folks here have talked about, how do you secure the borders? well, i've been leading the fight in the senate to triple the border patrol, to put in place fencings and walls, to put in place a strong biometric exit/entry system...",1
"yes, i would. and i've been there. and i've been there very strongly. i do have to say something, and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault. it's not ted's fault. justice roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by ted. justice roberts gave us obamacare. might as well be called roberts-care. two times of the supreme court, justice roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve. and we ended up with obamacare. that is a rough thing. and i know ted feels badly about it. and i think he probably still respects the judge. but that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way -- no way that he should have approved obamacare. now, with that being said, these are the things that happen. but ted very, very strongly pushed judge roberts, and justice roberts gave us something that we don't want.",1
"well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it. and i am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern. obviously, mrs. obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise. and i think has had a big impact. so whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution. and with respect to my own husband, i am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that. but i will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.",0
"i think this gets to the point of wisdom on when to intervene and when we shouldn't. had we bombed assad at the time, like president obama wanted, and like hillary clinton wanted and many republicans wanted, i think isis would be in damascus today. i think isis would be in charge of syria had we bombed assad. sometimes both sides of the civil war are evil, and sometimes intervention sometimes makes us less safe. this is real the debate we have to have in the middle east. every time we have toppled a secular dictator, we have gotten chaos, the rise of radical islam, and we're more at risk. so, i think we need to think before we act, and know most interventions, if not a lot of them in the middle east, have actually backfired on us.",1
"well, i respectfully disagree. i think we have achieved a great deal with the iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the iranian nuclear weapons program. that has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement. i do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with iran. yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism. yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the middle east, causing even more chaos. yes, they've got to get out of syria. they've got to quit sponsoring hezbollah and hamas. they have got to quit trying to ship rockets into gaza that can be used against israel. we have a lot of work to do with iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.",0

"of course not. this was a large and complicated bill. there were provisions in it that i think made sense. for example, do i think that a gun shop in the state of vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody, and that somebody goes out and does something crazy, that that gun shop owner should be held responsible? i don't. on the other hand, where you have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to criminals or aiding and abetting that, of course we should take action.",0
"look, we have a great president here, george bush, the 41st president of the united states. he worked with ronald reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem -- a path to legalization. you see, that was a time when things worked. it was a time when president reagan and george bush decided that we needed to make the country work. look, i think there is an answer here. the answer is you complete the border. you let people know that once it's done, you don't have a right to come in. if you come in, we don't want any excuse. you're going to go back. but i favor a guest worker program. i think it's practical. and i think for the 11 million or 11.5 million americans -- the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, i'd make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service. and at the end, i'd give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship. i don't think we're going to tear families apart. i don't think we're going to ride around in people's neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes. i don't think -- first of all, i don't think it's practical and i don't think it reflects america. you know what happened? the problem with president reagan is we didn't get in there and actually finish the border. and i think it was probably business interests that affected it. but at the end of the day, let's be practical. let's start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs. with president reagan and george bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and i think we can and should do it again. and i will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.",1
"that could very well be. but there's always give and take. there's always negotiation. and the best negotiator that knows what he's doing will make a great deal. but we need give and take in government. if you don't have give and take, you're never going to agree on anything.",1
"the truth of the matter is, net immigration from mexico last year was zero. fact check me. go ahead. check it out. but the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an american economy. that's what our parents and grandparents always did. that's what we need to do as a nation. yes, we must protect our borders. but there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the united states of america. our symbol is the statue of liberty. it is not a barbed wire fence.",0
"let me go back to the other just for a second. in large mosques, all over the middle east, you have people chanting ""death to the usa."" now, that does not sound like a friendly act to me. as far as the families are concerned, and as far as the law is concerned, we have a law -- this all started with your question on water boarding. we have a law that doesn't allow right now water boarding. they have no laws. they have no rules. they have no regulations. they chop off heads. they drown 40, 50, 60 people at a time in big steel cages, pull them up an hour later, everyone dead. and we're working on a different set of parameters. now, we have to obey the laws. have to obey the laws. but we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out isis and all of the others that are so bad. we better expand our laws or we're being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us. they are laughing at us, believe me.",1

"well, i think it's an important point the president made in his state of the union. and here's what i would say. i will go anywhere, to meet with anyone, at any time to find common ground. that's what i did as a first lady, when i worked with both democrats and republicans to get the children's health insurance program, when i worked with tom delay, one of the most partisan of republicans, to reform the adoption and foster care system. what i did, working in the senate, where i crossed the aisle often, working even with the senator from south carolina, lindsey graham, to get tricare for national guardsmen and women. and it's what i did as secretary of state, on numerous occasions, and most particularly, rounding up two-thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both russia and the united states. so i know it's hard, but i also know you've got to work at it every single day. i look out here, i see a lot of my friends from the congress. and i know that they work at it every single day. because maybe you can't only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows. if you're successful there, maybe you can build even more. that's what i would do.",0

"well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed. part of the problem that we have currently in the middle east is that assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of russia and iran and with the proxy of hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles. so i don't think you can paint with a broad brush. this is an incredibly complicated region of the world. it's become more complicated. and many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the united states has either started or have a role in. the shi'a-sunni split. the dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations. the increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life. we saw that in egypt. we saw a dictator overthrown. we saw a muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back. so, i think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the middle east.",0

"i will tell you what, anderson, after i investigated it, i concluded they did and here's why. there two big plane manufacturers in the world, there's airbus and boeing. airbus does everything it can to get contracts to sell planes everywhere in the world. we don't have as quite an aggressive outreach from our government. i did go in many places around the world to sell american products because the alternatives were usually european, asian, primarily chinese products. that to me was an unacceptable concession. so yes, boeing and other big companies get support just like their competitors do from the companies that they are from in the countries that provide the support.",0
"i'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the federal budget. you can't do it with empty promised. you know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt. i actually have a plan. i'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because i'm realistic. you just don't make promises like this. why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes. we'll just clean it up. where are you gonna clean it up? you have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending. you gotta be creative and imaginative. now, let me just be clear, john. i went into ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus. we're up 347,000 jobs. when i was in washington, i fought to get the budget balanced. i was the architect. it was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon. we cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when i left. that's was hard work. fiscal discipline, know what you're doing. creativity. this stuff is fantasy. just like getting rid of medicare and medicaid. come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that. it's not responsible.",1

"well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this and why donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue. because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of isis. if you listen to the state of the union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck. they are much more than that. this is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides. this is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against christians and yazidis and others in the region. this is not some small scale group. they are radicalizing people in the united states, they are conducting attacks around the world. so you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when i'm president. if we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when i am president, you are not getting into the united states of america.",1
"well, i know i've talked about it, and others in our campaign have talked about it, and other candidates have talked about it, as well. what happened in flint was a terrible thing. it was systemic breakdown at every level of government, at both the federal and partially the -- both the state and partially at the federal level, as well. and by the way, the politicizing of it i think is unfair, because i don't think that someone woke up one morning and said, ""let's figure out how to poison the water system to hurt someone.""",1

"and why i am a staunch supporter of president obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the affordable care act -- is because i know how hard it was to get that done. we are at 90 percent coverage. we have to get the remaining 10. i've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs. and it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share. but i think the american people deserve to know specifically how this would work. if it's medicare for all, then you no longer have the affordable care act, because the affordable care act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. the children's health insurance program, which i helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program. so if you're having medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. and based on every analysis that i can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.",0
"i don't think a halt is necessary. what we have to do is put all of our resources through the department of homeland security, through the state department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening. now, this takes, david, 18 months to 24 months, two years. so i know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done. but the process should move forward while we are also taking on isis, putting together the kind of strategy that i've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible. because i do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values. we don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve. so i want us to have a very tough screening process but i want that process to go forward. and if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and i would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go. i would prioritize them. and that would i think give the american public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.",0

"you know, franklin delano roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the american people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair. and he stood before the american people and he said, ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,"" a profound statement that gave the american people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression. and then what he did is redefine the role of government. you know, you had herbert hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit. so what if mass unemployment exists? so what if children are going hungry? that's not the role of the government. and when fdr said, ""yeah, it is,"" that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish. and kind of -- that's what i see our campaign is about right now. in this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the american people don't give up on the political process. don't listen to the trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us. if we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. we do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. in the same light, as the foreign leader, winston churchill's politics were not my politics. he was kind of a conservative guy in many respects. but nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the british people when they stood virtually alone against the nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory. those are two leaders that i admire very much.",0

"no. i think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in iraq, which i vigorously opposed. not only did i vote against it, i helped lead the opposition. and what happened there is yes, it's easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like saddam hussein, but there wasn't the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs. and who rises up? groups like isis. so i think that president obama made a promise to the american people when he ran, and he said you know what, i'm going to do my best to bring american troops home. and i supported what he did. our job is to train and provide military support for muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on isis. and one point i want to make here that is not made very often, you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region, countries like saudi arabia, countries like qatar. qatar happens to be the largest -- wealthiest country per capita in the world. they have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the united states to do it.",0

"the answer to both of those is no. i'm interested in making what we have work better. i want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant. i want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn't work, and be absolutely clear we're getting rid of what doesn't work. i have had the opportunity to run a big agency. i was very flattered when henry kissinger said i ran the state department better -- better than anybody had run it in a long time. so i have an idea of what it's going to take to make our government work more efficiently. and when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but i think it's not appropriate to say ""i'm going to get rid of this, get rid of that"" until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do. but i want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and i think it's the greatest work that americans will be called to do. and of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it. we have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in washington. but we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the american people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry. so i see as president having a constant dialogue with americans here's what we're trying to get done, here's why i need your help, here's why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn't something you care about, but i'm telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows --",0
"let me just tell you, first of all, i've been hearing this man so long talking about putin. putin said about me -- i didn't say about putin -- putin said very nice things about me. and i say very nicely, wouldn't it be nice if actually we could get along with russia, we could get along with foreign countries, instead of spending trillions and trillions of dollars? you're talking about flint, michigan. you're talking about places -- we need to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. wouldn't it be nice if we got along with the world, and maybe russia could help us in our quest to get rid of isis, et cetera, et cetera?",1
"states run by democrats and countries currently run by democrats. so the thing is, let's look for root causes. but i would also say -- lay some blame at the -- the feet of the federal reserve. i think the federal reserve has made this problem worse. by artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money. they're actually talking now about negative interest. the money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in new york. and because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. so what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality. we also find that as the federal reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst. so really we need to reexamine whether we not -- we want a federal reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates. we also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse. but the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a city with a republican mayor or a state with a republican governor.",1
"thank you for that question. i would begin by saying that i'm not sure it's a weakness, but i do believe that i share a sense of optimism for america's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people. i think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us. and that doesn't have to be true. our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now. if we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new american century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.",1
"typically, politicians do things that are politically expedient. and they are looking for whatever their particular goal is. that is not the reason that i have gotten into this thing. i'm extraordinary concerned about the direction of this country, the divisiveness that is going on, fiscal irresponsibility, the failure to take a leadership position in the world. all of those things will lead to a situation where the next generation will not have a chance that we've had now. so i don't -- i don't want to really get into describing who's a politician and who's not a politician, but i think the people have kind of made that decision for themselves already, and will continue to do so as time goes on.",1
"and so let me give you one. two days ago, i met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in bangladesh. it's a very tough place to be a missionary. it's muslim. and their safety and security very much relies upon friendly muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them. and their mission field really are muslims that are looking to convert to christianity as well. and they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in america, leading political figures are saying that america doesn't like muslims. so this is a real impact. there's no doubt that radical islam is a danger in the world. i can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially arlington, you're going to see crescent moons there. if you go anywhere in the world you're going see american men and women serving us in uniform that are muslims.",1

"well, there's no doubt, we have an enormous backlog of infrastructure repairs. here's what i'd do - the congress finally got around to pass the highway transportation bill, which should never have been partisan - it turned into be one partisan argument. i want to go further. i want to put 250 billion dollars additional, on top of what congress has done. that gets us to a half a billion. i want to start a national infrastructure bank. i want to capitalize it with 25 billion that i believe will leverage 10 times that, that's another 250 billion. so i'm trying to do this in a way that will gain support and be affordable but there's no doubt, we have to do more on our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports. and as we've talked in the beginning here, under our ground, our water systems, our sewer systems. we have pipelines that are leaking and that are dangerous. we have so much work to be done and if we can put millions of peoples to work, i think my plan is a very good way to begin doing that work and get people out there doing it.",0
"i have a difference of opinion with secretary clinton on this. our differences are fairly deep on this issue. we disagreed on the war in iraq. we both listened to the information from bush and cheney. i voted against the war. but i think -- and i say this with due respect -- that i worry too much that secretary clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be. yes, we could get rid of saddam hussein, but that destabilized the entire region. yes, we could get rid of gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for isis. yes, we could get rid of assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit isis. so i think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy. but before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after. and in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of assad, a terrible dictator. but i think in syria the primary focus now must be on destroying isis and working over the years to get rid of assad. that's the secondary issue.",0

"you know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics. we agree that wall street should never be allowed to wreck main street again. but here's the point i want to make tonight. i am not a single-issue candidate, and i do not believe we live in a single-issue country. i think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other american today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the lgbt community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what i want to take on. and here in wisconsin, i want to reiterate: we've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it",0

"well, the numbers the tax foundation had put out is that the static cost of the plan is $3.6 trillion over 10 years, but the dynamic cost of the plan, which -- which is the cost that factors in growth, is about $768 billion. it is less than a trillion. it costs less than virtually every other plan people have put up here, and yet it produces more growth and it's one of the very few plans that abolishes the irs. but on top of that, today, we rolled out a spending plan. $500 billion in specific cuts -- five major agencies that i would eliminate. the irs, the department of commerce, the department of energy, the department of commerce, and hud -- and then 25 specific programs. again, that's on our website at tedcruz.org. you want to look at specificity? it's easy for everyone to say, ""cut spending"". it's much harder and riskier to put out, chapter and verse, specifically the programs you would cut to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids.",1

"if it's being abused the way disney did. understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace american workers. under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing americans, but that you've tried to hire americans. and if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again. the second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. they are hiring a consulting company like tata, for example, out of india. that company then hoards up all of these visas. they hire workers. you hire -- disney or some other company hires this company. what they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. they are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business. and what i argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it. it is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace americans. and if a company is caught doing that, whether it be disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future.",1

"well, first of all, i must say as i think about that question, i think about a woman i met the other day. i would guess she was 40 years old. she had several children. and she said to me, you know, carly, i go to bed every night afraid for my children's future. and that really struck me. this is america. a mother is going to bed afraid for her children's future. and the reason she's afraid for her children's future is because we've had problems for a long time. yes, problems have gotten much worse under democrats. but the truth is, this government has been growing bigger and bigger, more corrupt, less effective, crushing the engine of economic growth for a very long time. this isn't about just replacing a democrat with a republican now. it's about actually challenging the status quo of big government. big government has created a big business called politics. and there are lots of people invested in the status quo of that big business called politics. specifically, we need actually to do five things to really get this economy going again. we need to go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dollar is being spent, we can challenge any dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar.",1

"well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop gadhafi from committing massacres against his people. the united states was asked to support the europeans and the arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, i recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of gadhafi. i think that what libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path. now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the arab spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that isis and other terrorist groups do. but what we're seeing happening in libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among libyans themselves to try to dislodge isis from sirte, the home town of gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government. you know, this is not easy work. we did a lot to help. we did as much as we could because the libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept. but we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.",0

"look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family. and if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all. simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do. you think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now. the big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this. and what i think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise. the government has tried it their way. under -- under barack obama and the proposals of hillary clinton and bernie sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably. we need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.",1

"right. what we have got to do there is, among other things, as i was just saying, have silicon valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the internet or in other ways by isis is, in fact, discovered. but i do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the american people.",0
"chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster. the way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to california, you could do pretty well. but in terms of the early states -- iowa, new hampshire, the other states -- it just doesn't work. your point is well taken. i believe in public funding of elections, absolutely. but this system is -- i don't know if the secretary would agree -- is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.",0
"i think it's fair to say, assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 syrians. the reason we are in the mess we're in, that isis has the territory it has, is because of assad. i advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when i was still secretary of state, because i worried we would end up exactly where we are now. and so, when we look at these complex problems, i wish it could be either/or. i wish we could say yes, let's go destroy isis and let's let assad continue to destroy syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute. no. we now finally are where we need to be. we have a strategy and a commitment to go after isis, which is a danger to us as well as the region...",0

"john, thank you, and to all of the people in iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process. if you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then i ask you to join my campaign. go on to martinomalley.com. no hour is too short, no dollar too small. if you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past. we are at the threshold of a new era of american progress, but it's going to require that we act as americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us. and, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners. there is no challenge too great for the united states to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days. i need your help. thank you very, very much.",0

"...in the situation room, going over some very difficult issues. you know, i -- i agree completely. we don't want american troops on the ground in syria. i never said that. what i said was we had to put together a coalition -- in fact, something that i worked on before i left the state department -- to do, and yes, that it should include arabs, people in the region. because what i worry about is what will happen with isis gaining more territory, having more reach, and, frankly, posing a threat to our friends and neighbors in the region and far beyond. so i think while you're talking about the tough decision that president obama had to make about osama bin laden, where i was one of his few advisers, or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on iran -- i think i have a lot of evidence...",0
"look, the secretary is right. this is a terribly complicated issue. there are no simple solutions. but where we have a disagreement is that i think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to mossadegh in iran, you go back to salvador allende who we overthrew in chile, you go back to overthrowing saddam hussein in iraq, you go back to where we are today in syria with a dictator named assad. the truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like america to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator. so i think secretary clinton and i have a fundamental disagreement. i'm not quite the fan of regime change that i believe she is.",0
"well, i was pleased that nato announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the mediterranean, in the aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the european union. and it's especially significant that they are working with both turkey and greece in order to do this. with respect to the united states, i think our role in nato, our support for the e.u., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part. and we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to turkey and to members of the e.u. in particular. this is a humanitarian catastrophe. there is no other description of it. so we do as the united states have to support our friends, our allies in europe. we have to stand with them. we have to provide financial support to them. we have to provide the nato support to back up the mission that is going on. and we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.",0
"we give up the power to amend. and i think, really, one of the big problems we have in our country is, over the last century, really, so much power has gravitated to the executive branch. really, congress is kind of a bystander. we don't write the rules. we don't make the laws. the executive branch does. so even in trade -- and i am for trade -- i think we should be careful about giving so much power to the presidency.",1

"let me just answer, i want to get back to this 2007 immigration bill. it's true, ted kennedy, a good friend of mine, and i think of the secretary's, did work very hard on that bill. but does anyone really believe that if that bill was all so good, as the secretary is touting, that lulac and other major latino organizations, the largest latino organizations in this country said no to that bill. and i worked very hard in improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill i strongly supported, people who were in the guest worker program in america would not be treated like slaves.",0
"well, first of all, i recognize that we have an incredible illegal immigration problem. i was down in arizona a few weeks ago at the border. i mean, the fences that were there were not manned, and those are the kind of fences when i was a kid that would barely slow us down. so, i don't see any purpose in having that. now, what we need to do is look at something that actually works. yuma county, arizona. they stop 97 percent of the illegal immigrants through there. they put in a double fence with a road so that there was quick access by the enforcement people. if we don't seal the border, the rest of this stuff clearly doesn't matter. it's kind of ridiculous all the other things we talk about. we have the ability to do it, we don't have the will to do it. there was one area where they had cut a hole in the fence, and to repair it, they put a few strands of barb wire across. well, the photographers who were there with us, they wanted to photograph us from the side of the mexicans, and they went through there, and they were not physically fit people, and they took their cameras and things with them, and shot us from the other side. that's how easy it is to get across. and, the drugs, i mean, it goes on, and on, and on. ice tells them to release these people, 67,000 criminals released...",1

"you know, 200 years ago, america was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government. our rights come from god. that's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world. that's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the american miracle. but now as i travel the country, people say what i feel. this country is changing. it feels different. we feel like we're being left behind and left out. and the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing america. we elected someone as president who wants to change america, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world. and so he undermines the constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military. and that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history. if we elect hillary clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first americans ever to inherit a diminished country. but if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the american dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.",1

"well, you know, , of course. i mean, if -- look, i was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church. religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in. no question and no doubt about it. now, in regard to same-sex marriage, i don't favor it. i've always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and i've moved on. and what i've said, hugh, is that, look, where does it end? if you're in the business of selling things, if you're not going to sell to somebody you don't agree with, ok, today i'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay, and tomorrow maybe i won't sell to somebody who's divorced. i mean, if you're in the business of commerce, conduct commerce. that's my view. and if you don't agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior. but when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and i would fight for those religious institutions. and look, i've appointed over a hundred judges as governor. i even appointed adjudge to the ohio supreme court. and you know what they are? they're conservatives. go check it out. they are conservatives. they don't make the law. they interpret the law. that's all they do. and they stick by the constitution. so i will do that. but let's just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that. i think my position is clear.",1
"wolf, unfortunately, it's the new normal under barack obama and hillary clinton. the fact is that if you listen to hillary clinton the other day, what she said to the american people was, as regards to isis, my strategy would be just about the same as the president's. just about the same as the president's? we have people across this country who are scared to death. because i could tell you this, as a former federal prosecutor, if a center for the developmentally disabled in san bernardino, california, is now a target for terrorists, that means everywhere in america is a target for these terrorists. now, i spent seven years of my life in the immediate aftermath of september 11th doing this work, working with the patriot act, working with our law enforcement, working with the surveillance community to make sure that we keep america safe. what we need to do, wolf, is restore those tools that have been taken away by the president and others, restore those tools to the nsa and to our entire surveillance and law enforcement community. we need a president who is going to understand what actionable intelligence looks like and act on it. and we need a president and a cabinet who understands that the first and most important priority of the president of the united states is to protect the safety and security of americans. as someone who has done it, i will make sure it gets done again.",1
"on this stage -- on this stage, you didn't hear anyone denigrate women, you didn't hear anyone make racist comments about new american immigrants, you didn't hear anyone speak ill of another american because of their religious belief. what you heard instead on this stage tonight was an honest search for the answers that will move our country forward, to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050, to take the actions that we have always taken as americans so that we can actually attack injustice in our country, employ more of our people, rebuild our cities and towns, educate our children at higher and better levels, and include more of our people in the economic, social, and political life of our country. i truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of american progress. unless you've become discouraged about our gridlock in congress, talk to our young people under 30, because you'll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples.",0

"well, the deal was done. barack obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts. you just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation. and now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth. and the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that barack obama got elected president. and now they see hillary clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country. we need to reverse that. and my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year. you don't have to guess about it, because i actually have a record. $19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created. we were one of two states to go to aaa bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.",1

"you did support a u.n. security council approach, which we did follow up on. and, look, i think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin laden. i looked at the evidence. i looked at the intelligence. i got the briefings. i recommended that the president go forward. it was a hard choice. not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that. and at the end of the day, it was the president's decision. so he had to leave the situation room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision. i'm proud that i gave him that advice. and i'm very grateful to the brave navy seals who carried out that mission.",0

"over the last year, we have received almost 7 million individual campaign contributions, averaging -- guess what -- $27 apiece, more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in american history at this point in a campaign. the reason that our campaign has done so well is because we're doing something very radical: we're telling the american people the truth. and the truth is that this country is not going to move forward in a significant way for working people unless we overturn this disastrous citizens united supreme court",0
"to be clear, what i said the other day was that we need to lift the political restrictions that are already in play. barack obama's administration has put political restrictions on the military personnel already in iraq. we need to lift those and then we need to listen to our military experts, not the political forces in the white house, but our military experts about how many more we sent in. and we certainly shouldn't have a commander-in-chief who sends a message to our adversaries as to how far we're going to go, and how far we're willing to fight, so i'm not putting a troop number. what i'm saying is lift the political restrictions. when you do that, you empower our military personnel already there to work with the kurd and the sunni allies, to reclaim the territory taken by isis. and to do so in a way that allows that isis doesn't go back in syria, as we were just talking about here. that is the fundamental problem going forward. we have a president -- and hillary clinton was a part of this, by the way, who has made political decisions for our men and women in uniform. i want the men and women at home to know, if i'm commander-in-chief, i will only send you into harm's way when our national security is at risk. and if we do, you know you'll have our full support, the support of the american people, and you'll have a clear path for victory.",1

"well, dana, the premise of your question is not accurate. i'm very proud to have joined with conservatives in both the senate and the house to reform how we target bad guys. and what the usa freedom act did is it did two things. number one, it ended the federal government's bulk collection of phone metadata of millions of law-abiding citizens. but number two in the second half of it that is critical. it strengthened the tools of national security and law enforcement to go after terrorists. it gave us greater tools and we are seeing those tools work right now in san bernardino. and in particular, what it did is the prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. when you had a terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily land lines. the usa freedom act expands that so now we have cell phones, now we have internet phones, now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys. you know what the obama administration keeps getting wrong is whenever anything bad happens they focus on law-abiding citizens instead of focusing on the bad guys. we need to focus on radical islamic terrorists and we need to stop them before they carry out acts of terror.",1

"now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it's easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions. the obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states. it has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core. now, the one silver lining of obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and i intend to do that.",1

"look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs. and i've done it when i was in washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. and our economy was growing like crazy. it's the same thing that i did in ohio. it's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why i think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. it requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. and if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world. but in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. we have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. and when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest. right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high. you have regulations -- i mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. they are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people. and i mean, are you kidding me? we're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline. those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. you will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. and how do i know it? because i've done it. i did it as the chairman of the budget committee, working with senator domenici. and i've done it in the state of ohio as the chief executive. our wages are growing faster than the national average. we're running surpluses. and we can take that message and that formula to washington to lift every single american to a better life.",1

"no, he's not lying, he's just wrong. i mean, so, there's a difference -- i'm the only guy on this stage who's put out a detailed, 12 point plan on entitlement reform and here's why -- because 71% of federal spending right now is on entitlements, and debt service, 71%. and we have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29%, and no time on the 71%, and that makes no sense. now, let me tell you exactly what we would do on social security. yes, we'd raise the retirement age two years, and phase it in over 25 years, that means we'd raise it one month a year for 25 years when we're all living longer, and living better lives. secondly, we would means test social security for those who are making over $200,000 dollars a year in retirement income, and have $4 to $5 million dollars in liquid assets saved. they don't need that social security check. social security is meant to be -- to make sure that no one who's worked hard, and played by the rules, and paid into the system grows old in poverty in america. if we don't deal with this problem, it will bankrupt our country, or lead to massive tax increases, neither one that we want in this country.",1

"you know, chuck, i've only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator. and i voted a multinational trade agreement when i was senator, the cafta agreement, because i did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of america, of our incomes, and i opposed it. i did hope that the tpp, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements. and i said that i was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that i was looking for. i waited until it had actually been negotiated because i did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration. once i saw what the outcome was, i opposed it. now i have a very clear view about this. we have to trade with the rest of the world. we are 5 percent of the world's population. we have to trade with the other 95 percent. and trade has to be reciprocal. that's the way the global economy works. but we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that american workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy. so it's not just what's in the trade agreement that i'm interested in. i did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from president bush with korea. we go the uaw on board because of changes we made. so there are changes that i believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but i do not currently support it as it is written.",0
"good. you're right. i want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create 13 million jobs. we do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the cayman islands, and not in some years, pay a nickel in taxes. yes, i do. i plead guilty. i want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college, or university, tuition free. and, by the way, i want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well. how do i pay for it?",0

"well, let me start by saying that senator sanders and i share some very big progressive goals. i've been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we're now on the path to achieving it. i don't want us to start over again. i think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare. i want to build on the progress we've made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage. and i don't want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar. so we have a difference. i also believe in affordable college, but i don't believe in free college, because every expert that i have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs. what i want to do is make sure middle class kids, not donald trump's kids, get to be able to afford college. i want to get the economy going again. it's not just enough about what we're against, as important as that is. i have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power. i also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again. and of course, i believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work. but the numbers just don't add up, from what senator sanders has been proposing. that's why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable. let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do. a progressive is someone who makes progress. that's what i intend to do.",0

"well, i think senator sanders has just reinforced my point. yes, when i was secretary of state i did urge, along with the department of defense and the cia that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against assad. the president said no. now, that's how it works. people who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision. so i think it's only fair to look at where we are in syria today. and, yes, i do still support a no-fly zone because i think we need to put in safe havens for those poor syrians who are fleeing both assad and isis and have some place that they can be safe.",0

"no, not at all. here's the reality of american economic life today. the reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process. the reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent. the reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the american people's needs and desires from what congress is doing. so to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution -- contributors. now all of the ideas that i'm talking about, they are not radical ideas. making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the united states. rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the cayman islands and other tax havens. that is not a radical idea. what we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors. when we do that, we can, in fact, transform america.",0

"let me -- let me respond again because the misrepresentation can't go unanswered here. first of all, that is something that is not fair about what i said. i did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country -- on their own, very often -- many of them not making it. and when they got here, they needed, as i have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision. we need to end private detention, we need to end family detention. and in 2006, when senator sanders was running for the senate from vermont, he voted in the house with hard-line republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those republicans to stand with vigilantes known as minute men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants. so i think when you were running for the senate, you made it clear by your vote, senator, that you were going to stand with the republicans. when you got to the senate in 2007, one of the first things you did was vote against ted kennedy's immigration reform which he'd been working on for years before you ever arrived.",0

"well, first of all, i supported the president's moves. i helped to implement some of them leading up to the announcements when i was secretary of state, expanding travel opportunities, remittances. and i certainly told the president toward the end of my time that i hoped he would be able to move toward diplomatic relations and to make more of an impact by building up the relationship. and there are no better ambassadors for freedom, democracy and economic opportunity than cuban americans. so the more that we can have that kind of movement back and forth, the more likely we are to be able to move cuba toward greater freedom, greater respect for rights. you know, i'm looking forward to following the president's trip. i do think meeting with dissidents, meeting with people who have been voices, tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important. the cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld, they deserve to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads. and i think both castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are not freely chosen by the people that are in cuba.",0

"you know, i think we need to set the record straight on this, because i think marco misspoke about the bill. on the gang of eight bill, there was no provisions really for extra scrutiny or safety for refugees. at the time the bill came up, two iraqi refugees came to my home town, bowling green, kentucky. their fingerprints were on a bomb from iraq. they were in the database, but we didn't pick them up. we relocated them here, put them in government housing, got them on food stamps. and we began providing for them, but we didn't have adequate security. on the gang of eight bill, on marco's bill, we had an opportunity. there was a conservative consensus for an amendment i put forward called trust, but verify that would have strengthened border security on both refugees, students and those coming here. and marco sided and i guess was more sympathetic to chuck schumer and to the president than he was to conservative principles. but this goes directly to national defense. and if he wants to run as a national -- national defense conservative, he's got to explain why he hasn't stepped up to support border security.",1

"you know, i want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about. crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in washington, d.c. for decades. what's crony capitalism? crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it. so why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating? why are there five even bigger wall street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on wall street? because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business. you see, folks, this is how socialism starts. government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem. this is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back. the student loan problem has been created by government. government trying to level the playing field between internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem. the fcc jumping in now and saying, ""we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the internet,"" is going to create massive problems. but guess who pushed for that regulation? the big internet companies. this is what's going on. big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage. it's why you see walgreens buying rite aid. it's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together. it's you see the health insurance companies getting together. it's why you see the banks consolidating. and meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed. community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed. community banks are going out of business. big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.",1

"let me agree. you know, as the secretary knows, i chaired -- i had the privilege and the honor of chairing the senate committee on veterans' affairs. and it is interesting to me, you know, republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans. i work with the american legion, the vfw, the dav, the vietnam vets, and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of america. that's what i did. and i brought it to the floor of the senate. every democrat voted for it, i got two republicans. we ended up with 56 votes and i couldn't get the 60 votes that i needed. that is pathetic. this was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them. so republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there. what i did next, rachel, is i had to retreat a little bit, i had to compromise. i did work with john mccain. i did work with jeff miller over in the house. and we put together not the bill that i wanted, but probably the most comprehensive v.a. health care bill in the modern history of this country. secretary clinton is absolutely right, there are people, koch brothers among others, who have a group called concerned veterans of america, funded by the koch brothers. the koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy social security, medicare, medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s. yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it. the last point that i'd make. i had a hearing. i had all of the veterans groups in front of me. and i said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the v.a., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good? without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good. we've got to strengthen the v.a. we do not privatize the v.a.",0

"this is what i would say lester, look see, i've listened to secretary clinton and senator sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and i would have to agree with both of them. they've both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue. i'm the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. this is very personal to me being from baltimore. i will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in johns' hopkins hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy's head was pierced with a bullet. and i remember visiting him, it did not kill him - i remember visiting him and his mother in johns hopkins hospital. he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet. and, i remember visiting him, it did not kill him. i remember visiting him and his mother in johns hopkins hospital. in his diapers with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy. so, after the slaughter of the kids in connecticut last year, we brought people together. we did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation. it did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what? we did not interrupt a single person's hunting season. i've never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an ar-15 to down a deer. and,",0

"not very far. i think we need to do this state by state. there are places that get this right, and we need to make sure that we protect the privacy laws. this is a complicated place. but i do think the natural impulse on the left -- hillary clinton, immediately after one of these horrific violent acts took place, immediately said we need to have federal gun laws. president obama almost reflexively always says the same thing. and the net result is, you're going to take away rights of -- of law-abiding citizens, the 99.999 percent of the people that are law- abiding citizens. that's not the right approach to do it. in florida, we have a background check. we have concealed-weapon permit holders, and in fact, there's 1,200,000 of them. we have a reduction in violent crime because we put people behind bars when they use a gun in the commission of the crime. that's the better approach. but we're living in a society today where despair kind of grows in isolation.",1

"so the world is changing faster than ever, and it is disruptive. number one, we are in a global competition now, and several of the candidates have said that. there are now dozens of developed economies on this planet that we have to compete with. and we lose that competition because we have the highest business tax rate in the industrialized world, because we have regulations that continue to grow by the billions every single week, because we have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people, but because we're not fully utilizing our energy resources, that if we did, it would bring back all kinds of growth, especially in manufacturing, and because we have an outdated higher education system. our higher education system is completely outdated. it is too expensive, too hard to access, and it doesn't teach 21st century skills. if we do what needs to be done -- tax reform, regulatory reform, fully utilize our energy resources, repeal and replace obamacare, and modernize higher education, then we can grasp the potential and the promise of this new economy. and we won't just save the american dream. we will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. and then truly this new century can be a new american century.",1

"well, it was very interesting having an opportunity to talk to the syrians themselves. and i asked them: what do you want? what is your supreme desire? their supreme desire was to be settled back in their own country. i said, ""what can americans and other countries do?"" they said, ""support the efforts of those who are trying to provide safety for us, including the jordanians."" of course, they had a brand new hospital, for instance, that was unstaffed because there wasn't enough money to do it. but here's what's really neat. if you go into hasakah province in northeast syria, that's an area that's as big as lebanon. it's controlled by the kurds, the christians and the moderate sunnis. and there are airstrips and hotels. you could settle a lot of people there. all we would have to do is be willing to provide them with some weaponry, some defensive weaponry. and we seem to be afraid to give the kurds weaponry. we like to send it for some strange reason through baghdad, and then they only get a tenth of it. and if we would support them, we'd have a perfect ideal there. we don't need to set this up as we either take a bunch of refugees who will be infiltrated with terrorists, i guarantee you. for them not to be would be terrorist malpractice. and we need to -- to choose the right choice, not these false choices.",1

"yes, their choice is very clear. if you look to the actual record -- you know, donald mentioned a moment ago that he was just doing business when he was writing checks to liberal democrats. but that's not, in fact, the checks he was writing. listen, we could all understand if you write a check to a city commission because you're looking for a zoning waiver on building a building. that may be corrupt, but you could understand real estate developers doing that.",1
"no, i oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items. that's what they're doing. they're taking money from social security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending. here's the thing. when you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government. in 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government. instead, the washington establishment raised both. we raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this. this is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left. right and left are spending us into oblivion. we should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.",1

"well, and i don't -- he may have lined up with their positions on this issue. but here is the bottom line. every proposal they put forward are going to be proposals that will make it harder to do business in america, that will make it harder to create jobs in america. single parents are already struggling across this country to provide for their families. maybe a billionaire here in california can afford an increase in their utility rates, but a working family in tampa, florida, or anywhere across this country cannot afford it. so we are not going to destroy our economy. we are not going to make america a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing, nothing to change our climate, to change our weather, because america is a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, absolutely. but america is not a planet. and we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore, china is. and they're drilling a hole and digging anywhere in the world that they can get a hold of. so the bottom line is, i am not in favor of any policies that make america a harder place for people to live, or to work, or to raise their families.",1

"and i recognize -- i recognize that donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in iowa. but the facts and the law here are really quite clear. under longstanding u.s. law, the child of a u.s. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen. if a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. that's why john mccain, even though he was born in panama, was eligible to run for president. if an american missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. that's why george romney, mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in mexico. at the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but i would note that the birther theories that donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on u.s. soil, but have two parents born on u.s. soil. under that theory, not only would i be disqualified, marco rubio would be disqualified, bobby jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, donald j. trump would be disqualified.",1

"well, let me begin by saying that we have to understand who isis is. isis is a radical sunni group. they cannot just be defeated through air strikes. air strikes are a key component of defeating them, but they must be defeated on the ground by a ground force. and that ground force must be primarily made up of sunni arabs themselves, sunni arabs that reject them ideologically and confront them militarily. we will have to embed additional american special operators alongside them to help them with training, to help them conduct special missions, and to help improve the air strikes. the air strikes are important, but we need to have an air force capable of it. and because of the budget cuts we are facing in this country, we are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest air force we have ever had. we have to reverse those cuts, in addition to the cuts to our navy and in addition to the cuts to our army, as well. and beyond that, i would say we must win the information war against isis. every war we have ever been involved in has had a propaganda informational aspect to it. isis is winning the propaganda war. they are recruiting people, including americans, to join them, with the promise that they are joining this great apocalyptic movement that is going to defeat the west. we have to show what life is really like in isis territory, and we have to show them why isis is not invincible, by going out and conducting these attacks and publicizing them to those who they recruit.",1

"i certainly agree with fdr for all the reasons senator sanders said. and i agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world. i would choose nelson mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation. but i want to -- i want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today senator sanders said that president obama failed the presidential leadership test. and this is not the first time that he has criticized president obama. in the past he has called him weak. he has called him a disappointment. he wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to president obama's leadership and legacy. and i just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments. you know, from my perspective, maybe because i understand what president obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the republicans in congress, i don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a",0

"well, i understand why they feel that way, because this president hasn't kept us safe. the problem is we had an attack in san bernardino. and we were paying attention to the most important issue we have faced in a decade since 9/11, and then all the talk was about this proposal, which isn't going to happen. but this is what's important to do is we must deal frontally with this threat of radical islamists, especially from isis. this is the most sophisticated terror group that has ever threatened the world or the united states of america. they are actively recruiting americans. the attacker in san bernardino was an american citizen, born and raised in this country. he was a health inspector; had a newborn child and left all that behind to kill 14 people. we also understand that this is a group that's growing in its governance of territory. it's not just iraq and syria. they are now a predominant group in libya. they are beginning to pop up in afghanistan. they are increasingly involved now in attacks in yemen. they have jordan in their sights. this group needs to be confronted with serious proposals. and this is a very significant threat we face. and the president has left us unsafe. he spoke the other night to the american people to reassure us. i wish he hadn't spoken at all. he made things worse. because what he basically said was we are going to keep doing what we're doing now, and what we are doing now is not working.",1

"well, first of all, delighted to be here. my family's here, and my little granddaughter, who's three years old, said she wanted to come to the debate. so this is very cool. as far as the minimum wage is concerned, people need to be educated on the minimum wage. every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases. it's particularly a problem in the black community. only 19.8 percent of black teenagers have a job, who are looking for one. you know, that -- and that's because of those high wages. if you lower those wages, that comes down. you know, i can remember, as a youngster -- you know, my first job working in a laboratory as a lab assistant, and multiple other jobs. but i would not have gotten those jobs if someone had to pay me a large amount of money. but what i did gain from those jobs is a tremendous amount of experience, and how to operate in the world and how to relate to different people, and how to become a responsible individual. and that's what gave me what i needed to ascend the ladder of opportunity in this country. that's what we need to be thinking about. how do we allow people to ascend the ladder of opportunity, rather than how do we give them everything and keep them dependent?",1

"well, first of all, just to be clear, not only did i serve for 18 years on the defense committee, more than anybody on this stage, but, secondly, i was called into the pentagon after 9/11 to help secretary rumsfeld with some of his difficulties. i will say, look, let me tell you what happened with libya. and i pointed out in the last debate -- hillary clinton worked aggressively to depose moammar gadhafi. we had no business doing it. he was working with us. he was cooperating with us. he denuclearized. and now they pushed him out, and now we have a fertile ground for isis. fortunately in libya, there's only a few cities on the coast, because most of libya is a desert. the fact of the matter is, we absolutely have to be -- and not just with special forces. i mean, that's not going to work. come on. you've got to go back to the invasion when we pushed saddam hussein out of kuwait. we have to be there on the ground in significant numbers. we do have to include our muslim arab friends to work with us on that. and we have to be in the air. and we -- it should be a broad coalition, made up of the kinds of people that were involved when we defeated saddam. now, you've got to be on the ground and in the air both in syria and iraq. and at some point, we will have to deal with libya. i am very concerned about isis getting their hands on the oilfields in libya and being able to fund their operations. the fact is cool, calm, deliberate, effective, take care of the job, and then come home. that's what we need to do with our military foreign policy.",1
"well, neil, i think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach. and your point is absolutely well taken. the cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation. there are a lot of factors involved in that. and that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums. maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members. but...",0

"and in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict women's rights. we have a presidential candidate by the name of donald trump saying that women should be punished. and we are never asked about this. and to be complete in my concern, senator sanders says with respect to trump it was a distraction. i don't think it's a distraction. it goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending planned parenthood from these outrageous attacks.",0

"well, i have been several times in your services and have joined in those prayers and have also been privileged to lead them in some settings. i pray very specifically for people whom i know by name. people who either have gone through or are experiencing difficult times, illness, divorce, death, disappointment, all of the life experiences that confront most of us. i pray for the will of god to be known that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it. i have said many times that, you know, i am a praying person, and if i haven't been during the time i was in the white house, i would have become one. because it's very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith. so i do pray for people in authority. i try to think about what they are going through, even when i disagree with them. trying to find some common ground, some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic. i don't always succeed. i will tell you that. so i pray on a pretty regular basis during the day, because i need that strength and i need that support. and especially when you are in the position that i'm in and that senator sanders is in, where you are asking people to vote for you, to give you the most important job, not only in our country, but i would argue in the world. i think humility is one of the most important attributes that you bring to both that seeking and then if you're fortunate enough, to that holding of office and that's what i will try to do.",0
"no, actually i believe that i am where the democratic party traditionally has been. the democratic party, and the reason i've decided to run as a democrat, has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice. and that is not determined by race. and as a clarification, i have always supported affirmative action for african americans. that's the way the program was originally designed because of their unique history in this country, with slavery and the jim crow laws that followed. what i have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone, quote, ""of color,"" other than whites, struggling whites like the families in the appalachian mountains, we're not being true to the democratic party principle of elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have -- by culture, by the way.",0

"well, i would love the relationship between cuba and the united states to change. but it will require cuba to change, at least its government. today, it has not. the fact of the matter is that after these changes were made -- after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the castro regime. it will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone. they will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there. they'll put a puppet figure forward as their new president. and nothing will change for the cuban people. there has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights. in fact, things are worse than they were before this opening. the only thing that's changed as a result of this opening is that now the cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently. and we asked nothing in return. compare that to the changes that were required in burma. and by no means is burma a perfect country. but at least when there was a democratic opening to burma, they were required to make some democratic openings. when there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening. and today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body. he asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return. and cuba and its regime remains an anti-american communist dictatorship, helped north korea evade u.n. sanctions. it's harboring fugitives of american justice, including people stealing our medicare money and moving back to cuba, all in exchange for nothing.",1
"and that is important, because now we have a u.n. security council that will enable us to do that. and, you know, with all due respect, senator, you voted for regime change with respect to libya. you joined the senate in voting to get rid of gadhafi, and you asked that there be a security council validation of that with a resolution. all of these are very difficult issues. i know that; i've been dealing with them for a long time. and, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like gadhafi, a despot with american blood on his hands, is overturned. but i'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our european partners and our arab partners to assist the people in libya, you would be looking at syria. now the libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge isis from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.",0
"thanks for coming back to me, maria. both donald and jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground. donald is right that china is running over president obama like he is a child, president obama is not protecting american workers and we are getting hammered. you know, i sat down with the senior leadership of john deere. they discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in china, because all the regulatory barriers. they're protectionist. but jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt iowa farmers and south carolina producers and 20 percent of the american jobs that depend on exports. so the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan i've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the",1

"well maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the new york times. you know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views. the new york times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, ""anybody but cruz."" had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, ""it follows"" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people. so you know the new york times and i don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships. now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when i was running for senate -- unlike hillary clinton, i don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. when i was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. he put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife heidi and i, we ended up investing everything we owned. we took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. and the entire new york times attack -- is that i disclosed that loan on one filing with the united states senate, that was a public filing. but it was not on a second filing with fdic and yes, i made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. but if that's the best the new york times has got, they better go back to the well.",1
"yeah, a couple points. in 2013 we had never faced a crisis like the syrian refugee crisis now. up until that point, a refugee meant someone fleeing oppression, fleeing communism like it is in my community. as far as ted's record, i'm always puzzled by his attack on this issue. ted, you support legalizing people who are in this country illegally. ted cruz supported a 500-percent increase in the number of h-1 visas, the guest workers that are allowed into this country, and ted supports doubling the number of green cards. so i think what's important for us to understand and there is a way forward on this issue that we an bring our country together on. and while i'm president i will do it. and it will begin by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving to the american people.",1

"i don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something. in fact, that's part of the problem. if you saw that blimp that got cut loose from maryland today, it's a perfect example of government. i mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it. that is our government today. we saw it in the blimp.",1

"let me -- let me just say this. what a president of the united states has got to do and what is his or her major, i think, responsibility is to, a, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values, that we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity. i voted against the war in iraq because i listened very carefully to what president bush and vice president cheney had to say and i didn't believe them. and if you go to my web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what i feared would happen when i spoke on the floor of the house, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. now i think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where secretary clinton and i disagree is the area of regime change. look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the united states, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. and god only knows saddam hussein was a brutal dictator. we could overthrow assad tomorrow if we wanted to. we got rid of gadhafi. but the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after. and in libya, for example, the united states, secretary clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi. but what happened is a political vacuum developed. isis came in, and now occupies significant territory in libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. but this is nothing new. this has gone on 50 or 60 years where the united states has been involved in overthrowing governments. mossadegh back in 1953. nobody knows who mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of iran. he was overthrown by british and american interests because he threatened oil interests of the british. and as a result of that, the shah of iran came in, terrible dictator. the result of that, you had the iranian revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. unintended consequences. so i believe as president i will look very carefully about unintended consequences. i will do everything i can to make certain that the united states and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the middle east.",0

"of course i can work with them, but let's be clear. when i talked about boeing and i talked about general electric, what i was referring to is an outrage. i suspect the secretary agrees request me. right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the cayman islands, bermuda, and other tax havens. and in a given year, rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much they're paying in taxes to the united states government in a given year? zero. now explain to me how that makes any sense at all. so what i have said with regard to boeing and ge and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what we're going to do? we're going to end that loophole. they are going to pay their fair share of taxes. we're going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs. can i work with corporations? are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development? absolutely they are. and we should be proud of them. but on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the american worker, who have said, if i can make another nickel in profit by going to china and shutting down in the united states of america, that's what i will do. i will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the united states of america.",0
"well maria, i would note you made the exact same point here that i made at the last debate, and you're right that senator rubio called me a liar for saying that. you know, we've both seen at home when washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program. well, it'll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future. that, inevitably, is when a politician doesn't plan to end it at all. you know, i'm reminded of that that is the same position that marco took in iowa on ethanol subsidies. when i campaigned in iowa, i took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies. marco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty. well, someday it should end, just not now. and, frankly, i think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem.",1
"well, what i said, after we seal the borders, after we turn off the spigot that dispenses all the goodies so we don't have people coming in here, including employment, that people who had a pristine record, we should consider allowing them to become guest workers, primarily in the agricultural sphere, because that's the place where americans don't seem to want to work. that's what i said. and they have a six-month period to do that. if they don't do it within that time period, then they become illegal, and as illegals, they will be treated as such.",1
"my wife, jane, has been -- way back when before i knew her, a foster parent. many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed. and she turned around many lives. she is the best parent and grandmother that i know. she has devoted her life, when i was mayor of the city of burlington, actually when i first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper. we got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues. she led that effort. so i think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, i think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and i think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.",0
"what we have to do is end over-policing in african-american neighborhoods. the reality is that both the african-american community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates. the reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana. truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations. the truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites. we need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system. i would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often african-americans, shot by police officers. what we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.",0

"well, i wanted to say, and i'll do it quickly, i was very pleased that leaders of president obama's administration went out to silicon valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do, consistent with privacy and security. we need better intelligence cooperation, we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world. and then, we've got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among muslim americans. and it is not only shameful, it is dangerous for the kinds of comments you're hearing from the republican side. we need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves, and working with muslim americans.",0
"no, i've never made a promise like that. but unlike either of these two fine people, i've actually balanced a budget every single year. i was one -- i was the only -- one of only seven states that had a aaa bond rating. by the time i left, the average tax burden on maryland families was the same as when i started. but i did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent. david, look, this is the big -- i agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave. and i agree with senator sanders on that. and just like social security and unlike the republicans, i think we should actually expand social security and increase average monthly benefits. but look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains. if we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again. so the things i have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up. that's the issue that we need to tackle as americans, and we can do it and we know how.",0

"well, bret, what i've argued from the very beginning is isis -- in order to defeat isis, you must deny them operating spaces. this is how isis or any radical group, for that matter, can grow. it's how al qaida was able to carry out 9/11, is that the taliban gave them an operating space in afghanistan. today that operating space has largely been based in iraq and syria, but i've been warning about the libyan presence for the better part of two years. so they need to be targeted wherever they have an operating space. they do need to be defeated on the ground by a ground force made up primarily of sunni arabs themselves. this is a radical sunni movement. they can only be defeated if they are driven out and the territory is held by sunni arabs. but it will require a specific number of american special operators, in combination with an increase in air strikes. and that will include, if necessary, operating spaces in libya, which, in fact, they are using to project into the sinai against egypt and ultimately into europe, as well.",1
"you know, if we're going to argue about the 1990's instead of talking about the future, which i'd much prefer because i think every election is about the future, and you all deserve to know what we will do to help you have a brighter future -- but, if we are going to talk about the 1990's i think it's only fair to say that at the end of the 1990's, after two terms of my husband's presidency, the unemployment rate in michigan was 4.4 percent. there had been a net increase of 54,000 manufacturing jobs. there had been a net increase of 653,000 jobs overall. and, one of the ways jobs were brought to, and grown here in michigan was through something called the export-import bank which helped a lot of businesses, particularly small businesses, be able to export around the world. senator sanders opposes that. i think we're in a race for exports. i think china, germany, everybody else supports their businesses. here in michigan there's been $11 billion dollars in recent years used to support exports, primarily from small businesses. i favor that, he's opposed it. i want to do everything i can for us to compete and win in the global economy...",0

"now, number three -- and let me say this -- when governor o'malley was heading the democratic governors association, he had no trouble at all going to wall street to raise money to run campaigns for democratic governors. and he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor. so, you know, again, the difference between us and the republicans is night and day. and there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the sec and the commodities future trading commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of lehman brothers, and that was senator sanders. so if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every american. and if that means taking on wall street, i have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both senator sanders and governor o'malley are proposing.",0

"this is a very important point in this debate, because i do believe in universal coverage. remember, i fought for it 25 years ago. i believe in it. and i know that thanks the affordable care act, we are now 90 percent of universal coverage. i will build on the affordable care act. i will take it further. i will reduce the cost. but i just respectfully disagree. between the republicans trying to repeal the first chance we've ever had to get to universal health care, and senator sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over single-payer, i think the smart approach is build on and protect the affordable care act. make it work. reduce the cost.",0
"i can only say this, and i've said it loud and clear and i've said it for years. and many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now -- your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they're packed with you. i've had an amazing relationship with politicians -- with politicians both democrat, republican, because i was a businessman. as one magazine said, he's a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. i got along with everybody. you get along with nobody. you don't have one republican -- you don't have one republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time. these are minor details. but you don't have one republican senator backing you; not one. you don't have the endorsement of one republican senator and you work with these people. you should be ashamed of yourself.",1
"you're right, jake. but it has been taken over by the federal government. it was originally supposed to be that way. and certainly sounds better that way. but it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in washington, and they are not interested in what's happening in miami or in florida, in many cases. now in some cases they would be. but in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children.",1
"well, i think the most important thing we can do when it comes to policing -- it's something you've had a guest on who's a friend of mine milwaukee county sheriff david clark, who's talked to me about this many times in the past -- it's about training. it's about making sure that law enforcement professionals, not only in the way in to their positions but all the way through their time, have the proper training, particularly when it comes to the use of force. and that we protect and stand up and support those men and women who are doing their jobs in law enforcement. and for the very few that don't, that there are consequences to show that we treat everyone the same here in america.",1
"well, i mean right here. to talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government? and we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse? or that we're just going to be great? or we're going to ship 10 million americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families? folks, we've got to wake up. we cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job. you have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline. and i spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in ohio. and i will go back to washington with my plan.",1
"and, anderson, i also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own party to get this done. look, it's fine to talk about all of these things -- and i'm glad we're talking about these things -- but i've actually done them. we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation, not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said. we actually did it. and, anderson, here tonight in our audience are two people that make this issue very, very real. sandy and lonnie phillips are here from colorado. and their daughter, jessie, was one of those who lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in aurora. now, to try to transform their grief, they went to court, where sometimes progress does happen when you file in court, but in this case, you want to talk about a -- a rigged game, senator? the game was rigged. a man had sold 4,000 rounds of military ammunition to this -- this person that killed their daughter, riddled her body with five bullets, and he didn't even ask where it was going. and not only did their case get thrown out of court, they were slapped with $200,000 in court fees because of the way that the nra gets its way in our congress and we take a backseat. it's time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation.",0

"well, ladies and gentlemen, i love being here in michigan, and i want to say to all of you here that i have a record of being able to solve some of the biggest problems. it's not just talk, and it's not theory. i did it in washington by helping people get into a healthier economic situation. i've done it in ohio. and as we've made progress in ohio, we've left no one behind. we've not left behind the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor, the developmental disabled, and we have raised our minority community. and as president of the united states, i will go back to washington, i will take the formulas that i used, and i will -- i will fix the problems in washington, and you'll work with me as i send you power to fix your -- your communities, your neighborhoods, your state, and together, we'll restore the spirit of america. and i know you want that. thank you.",1

"you know? the middle class -- anderson, and let me say something about the media, as well. i go around the country, talk to a whole lot of people. middle class in this country is collapsing. we have 27 million people living in poverty. we have massive wealth and income inequality. our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs. the american people want to know whether we're going to have a democracy or an oligarchy as a result of citizens union. enough of the e-mails. let's talk about the real issues facing america.",0

"all right, look, this has been a great debate. a lot of interesting issues have come together. let me conclude by just saying this. there is no president, in my view, not hillary clinton, not bernie sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on wall street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone. this campaign is not just about electing a president. what this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns. young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon. it ain't going to happen. low income people who are not involved in the political process. what this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power. thank you all very much.",0
"let me just pick up on this point. this whole discussion began because i commented, not making overall evaluation about the secretary. she was in ohio, i think, in september or november and she got up and said something like, i have been -- i'm paraphrasing, i have been criticized because people think i'm a moderate. well, i am a moderate. that's where this came from. it wasn't me paraphrasing her. it is what she said, and all that i said was there's nothing wrong with being a moderate. but, you can't be a moderate, you can't a progressive. in terms of president obama, i think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit. the world's financial system on the verge of collapse. i think that president obama, vice president biden, and the democratic leadership in the house and the senate have done a fantastic job. we are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago. that's the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go. do i think president obama is a progressive? yes, i do. i disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement. but, yes, i think he has done an excellent job.",0

"we worked to create jobs -- despite the disastrous policies of george w. bush -- across new york. and we stood up time and time again against all kinds of vested powerful interests. i'm asking for your support again in the primary on tuesday to continue that work together, to take what we did in new york and to take those new york values to the white house, and put them to work on behalf of all of our people, to knock down the barriers that stand in the way. you know, of course we have economic barriers. i've been fighting against those trying to even the odds most of my adult life. but we also have racial barriers, gender barriers, homophobic barriers, disability barriers.",0
"because what her campaign was saying -- bernie sanders, who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end medicare, end medicaid, end the children's health insurance program. that is nonsense. what a medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right. now, the truth is, that frank delano roosevelt, harry truman, do you know what they believed in? they believed that health care should be available to all of our people. i'm on the committee that wrote the affordable care act. i made the affordable care act along with jim clyburn a better piece of legislation. i voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. we are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off. and here's the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. my proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks. that's the vision we need to take.",0
"good evening. my story, from secretary to ceo, is only possible in this nation, and proves that everyone of us has potential. my husband, frank, of 30 years, started out driving a tow truck for a family owned auto body shop. we have come to a pivotal point in our nation's history where this nation's possibilities and potential are being crushed by a government grown so big, so powerful, so inept, so corrupt, and a political class that refuses to do anything about it. i am prepared to lead the resurgence of this great nation.",1
"secretary clinton called them out. oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this. and was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements? so they must have been very, very upset by what you did. look, here is the difference and here is the clear difference. these banks, in my view, have too much power. they have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy. if elected president, i will break them up. we have got legislation to do that, end of discussion.",0
"so, they can kill us, but we can't kill them? that's what you're saying. and as far as the internet is concerned, we're not talking about closing the internet. i'm talking about parts of syria, parts of iraq, where isis is, spotting it. now, you could close it. what i like even better than that is getting our smartest and getting our best to infiltrate their internet, so that we know exactly where they're going, exactly where they're going to be. i like that better.",1
"....neil, a point that i'd like to make about the tax credits. we have to decide what is conservative and what isn't conservative. is it fiscally conservative to have a trillion-dollar expenditure? we're not talking about giving people back their tax money. he's talking about giving people money they didn't pay. it's a welfare transfer payment. so here's what we have. is it conservative to have $1 trillion in transfer payments -- a new welfare program that's a refundable tax credit? add that to marco's plan for $1 trillion in new military spending, and you get something that looks, to me, not very conservative. thank you.",1

"during the cold war -- during the cold war, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the u.s. jersey. we got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the united states. look what we did in iran with mossadegh. and look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that. i would suggest to you that we need to leave the cold war behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves. i mean, i know secretary clinton was gleeful when gadhafi was torn apart. and the world, no doubt is a better place without him. but look, we didn't know what was happening next. and we fell into the same trap with assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, assad must go. we have a role to play in this world. but we need to leave the cold war and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.",0

"the fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. the first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. and the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word. lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that i'm misunderstood. and so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a christie administration, they know we're going to keep it. next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. and this president, given what ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right. it's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that secretary kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better. the president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does secretary clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight. if you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give hillary clinton a third term of barack obama's leadership. i will not do that. if i'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the white house.",1

"on january 20th, 2017, the next president of the united states will walk into the white house. if, heaven forbid, that next president is a republican, i think it's pretty clear we know what will happen. a lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk. social security, which republicans call a ponzi scheme, may face privatization. our vets may see the v.a. hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization. planned parenthood will be defunded. the list goes on because the differences are so stark. you know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that. this is a watershed election. i know how important it is that we have a democrat succeed president obama in the white house. and i will do all that i can in this campaign to reach out and explain what i stand for and what i will do as president. you know, i became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so i spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future. but as president, i will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because i want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her god-given potential. if you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission. thank you, good night and may the force be with you.",0

"well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, i've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of dodd-frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the federal reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk. i think that's a major accomplishment. i agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which senator sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason. i go further in the plan that i've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face. it was an investment bank, lehman brothers, that contributed to our collapse. it was a big insurance company, aig. it was countrywide mortgage. my plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be. and i believe that not only barney frank, paul krugman, and others, have said that what i have proposed is the most effective. it goes in the right direction. we have dodd-frank. we can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate. but let's not kid ourselves. as we speak, there are new problems on the horizon. i want to get ahead of those, and that's why i've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of",0

"no, well, he has given us a good, good basis and foundation. we have got to do better than that. and of course we should. but here's what i would do. i would end -- i would make sure that the department of justice investigated every killing of a citizen of this country when they are under apprehension from a police officer or when they are killed in police custody. i would end the militarization of local police departments.",0
"the leader of goldman sachs is a billionaire who comes to congress and tells us we should cut social security, medicare, and medicaid. secretary clinton -- and you're not the only one, so i don't mean to just point the finger at you, you've received over $600,000 in speaking fees from goldman sachs in one year. i find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence.",0
"let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product. you're talking about $2.7 trillion. we have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion. but if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly. so that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.",1
"i guess the one i -- i would pick is the fact that i was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after bin laden. i spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us. but probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it. the intelligence was by no means absolute. we had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, i recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin laden and to finally bring him to justice. it was an excruciating experience. i couldn't talk to anybody about it. in fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to bill, ""well i assume hillary has told you about this."" and bill said, ""no, no, she hasn't."" there was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.",0

"first of, jake, i don't yield to anybody on how to enforce the law. i'm the only person on this stage who spent seven years as a united states attorney after september 11th, and i know how to do this. the fact is though that for 15,000 people a day to be deported every day for two years is an undertaking that almost none of us could accomplish given the current levels of funding, and the current number of law enforcement officers. here's what we need to do, and i think this is where donald is absolutely right. what we need to do is to secure our border, and we need to do it with more than just a wall. we need to use electronics, we need to use drones, we need to use fbi, dea, and atf, and yes, we need to take the fingerprint of every person who comes into this country on a visa, and when they overstay their visa, we need to tap them on the shoulder, and say, ""you have overstayed your welcome, you're taking advantage of the american people. it's time for you to go."" if we had that kind of system in place, we wouldn't have the 11 million people we have now.",1
when i'm president it will not be dealt with the way it was done in the senate. it will be done first and foremost by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving it to the american people. and only after that is done can anything else happen. and it will be something the american people support. we'll see what they are willing to support. it's not going to be an executive order and we're not going to ram it down their throats.,1
"well, rick, it's a very important question. i have got deep concerns about the fed. the first thing i think we need to do is audit the fed. and i am an original co-sponsor of rand paul's audit the fed legislation. the second thing we need to do is i think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, qe1, qe2, qe3, qe- infinity. and the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, becky asked, was about working women. you know, it's interesting, you look at on wall street, the fed is doing great. it's driving up stock prices. wall street is doing great. you know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928. but if you look at working men and women. if you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent. she sees her cost of electricity going up. she sees her health insurance going up. and loose money is one of the major problems. we need sound money. and i think the fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.",1

"you know, listening to this conversation, let me just say, we have a lot of argument about laws but none of it solves the problem. let's examine what happened, why did we miss the tsarnaev brothers, why did we miss the san bernardino couple? it wasn't because we had stopped collected metadata it was because, i think, as someone who comes from the technology world, we were using the wrong algorithms. this is a place where the private sector could be helpful because the government is woefully behind the technology curve. but secondly, the bureaucratic processes that have been in place since 9/11 are woefully inadequate as well. what do we now know? that dhs vets people by going into databases of known or suspected terrorists. and yet, we also know that isis is recruiting who are not in those databases. so of course, we're going to miss them. and then we now learn that dhs says, ""no, we can't check their social media."" for heaven's sakes, every parent in america is checking social media and every employer is as well, but our government can't do it. the bureaucratic procedures are so far behind. our government has become incompetent, unresponsive, corrupt. and that incompetence, ineptitude, lack of accountability is now dangerous. it is why we need a different kind of leadership in the white house that understands how to get bureaucracies competent again.",1
"well, first of all, i disagree with that study. there are many economists who come up with very, very different numbers. for example, we are the only country, major country on earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people, and yet we end up spending almost three times what the british do, 50 percent more than the french. my proposal, a medicare-for-all, single-payer program, will",0

"this is what i think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that african american youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in america doesn't have any disposable income. you have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour. when we put money into the hands of working people, they're going to go out and buy goods, they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that. kathie, that is the kind of economy i believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.",0

"well, first of all, we hear about taking on washington. i took on washington and i won. i actually got the budget balanced when i was a member of the congress, the chairman of the budget committee. we paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt. we also balanced the budget four years in a row. and we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then. i also had a plan in 1999 to save social security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have social security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts. now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a ufo than a social security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous. i have a plan to fix it that doesn't even require raising the retirement age. if you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on social security, you'll still get it. it will just simply be less. and for those people who depend on that social security, they'll get their full benefit. that's the way it will work. and we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age. and how do i know that? i've done all this before. this is not a theory. do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget? yes. it doesn't mean you have to cut them. it means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st century. so not only did we have a balanced budget in washington, but when i went to ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we're $2 billion in the black. our credit is strong. we're up 400,000 jobs. and i want to go back with the same formula to beat the washington insiders again. and i will get it done, and this country will be much stronger economically as a result.",1

"to begin with, moammar gadhafi and the revolt against gadhafi was not started by the united states. it was started by the libyan people. and the reason why i argued we needed to get involved is because he was going to go one way or the other. and my argument then was proven true, and that is, the longer that civil war took, the more militias would be formed and the more unstable the country would be after the fact. as far as moammar gadhafi is concerned, by the way, moammar gadhafi is the man that killed those americans over lockerbie, scotland. moammar gadhafi is also the man that bombed that cafe in berlin and killed those marines. and you want to know why moammar gadhafi started cooperating on his nuclear program? because we got rid of saddam hussein. and so he got scared that he would be next, and that's why he started cooperating. look, we will have to work around the world with less than ideal governments. the government in saudi arabia is not a democracy, but we will have to work with them. the government in jordan is not perfect, but we will have to work with them. but anti-american dictators like assad, who help hezbollah, who helped get those ieds into iraq, if they go, i will not shed a tear.",1

"all right. first of all, let me just explain. i was the first one to file a financial disclosure form -- almost 100 pages. you don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return. you learn it from statements. i filed -- which shows that i'm worth over $10 billion. i built a great company with very little debt. people were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down. and i filed it on time. i didn't ask for five 45-day extensions, which i would have been entitled to. so as far as that's concerned, i filed it. and that's where you find out what kind of a company. you don't learn anything from a tax return. i will say this. mitt romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed. and harry reid baited him so beautifully. and mitt romney didn't file his return until a september 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election. and it cost him big league. as far as my return, i want to file it, except for many years, i've been audited every year. twelve years, or something like that. every year they audit me, audit me, audit me. nobody gets audited -- i have friends that are very wealthy people. they never get audited. i get audited every year. i will absolutely give my return, but i'm being audited now for two or three years, so i can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously. and i think people would understand that.",1
"no. what they would -- look, this is what i believe, jorge. this is the year 2016. fifty years ago a high school degree got you a good job in the economy. today, in many respects, a college degree is the equivalent of a high school degree. we have got to go beyond first grade to 12th grade when we talk about public education.",0
"...to seek the american dream. and, we can embrace legal immigration while believing in the rule of law -- and i would note, try going illegally to another country. try going to china, or japan. try going to mexico. see what they do. every sovereign nation secures its borders, and it is not compassionate to say we're not going to enforce the laws...",1
"kevin, if i could just jump in. i -- i believe that we should make community college free. we should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university. you should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition. i want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not. i disagree with free college for everybody. i don't think taxpayers should be paying to send donald trump's kids to college. i think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute. and together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future.",0
"... having said that, i don't think i'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from wall street. i don't have a super pac. i don't want campaign contributions from corporate america. and let me be clear: while there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and i say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of wall street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of americans. we need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and i will fight and lead to make that happen.",0
"he called for lifting the cap, which is now higher -- it's at 118 -- and starting at 250 and going on up. if you do that, you're going to extend the life of social security for 58 years. you will significantly expand benefits by 1,300 bucks a year for seniors and disabled vets under $16,000 a year. what's wrong with that? are you prepared to support it?",0
"... well, senator, no one wants to see that happen. i mean, look, i care deeply about this because just like you i have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water. this was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again. we have no disagreement about this. but, i think it's a broader target list than just wall street, and i believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the american people. and, i think i have that kind of experience, maybe because they've beat me up for so many years, and i know exactly how to handle them because i've been in the arena with them time and time again.",0
"and i intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the american people. you know, i believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about, like how are we going to make college affordable? how are we going to pay down student debt?",0
"but i want to talk -- i want to talk about something else, because secretary clinton i think made some interesting and good points. what you have now is a very dangerous moment in american history. the secretary is right: our people are fearful. they are anxious on a number of levels. they are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on america. we all understand that. but you know what else they're anxious about? they're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent. and they're looking around them, and they're looking at washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, i'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it? what are you going to do for my kids? and somebody like a trump comes along and says, i know the answers. the answer is that all of the mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the mexicans. those are your enemies. we hate all the muslims, because all of the muslims are terrorists. we've got to hate the muslims. meanwhile, the rich get richer. so what i say to those people who go to donald trump's rallies, understand: he thinks a low minimum wage in america is a good idea. he thinks low wages are a good idea. i believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from. let's create an america that works for all of us, not the handful on top.",0
"if i could just respond. two points. one, senator sanders voted in 1998 on what i think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to iraq, calling for the end of saddam hussein's regime. he voted in favor of regime change with libya, voted in favor of the security council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on. i do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat isis in 2016. it's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in. when people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in-chief. and it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them. as we all remember, senator obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in iraq. and yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state. i was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.",0

"wait a minute. i just think it's worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry, the koch brothers, have just paid to put up an ad praising senator sanders. there are a lot of different powerful interests in washington. i've taken them on. i took on the drug companies. i took on the insurance companies. before there was something called obamacare, there was something called hillarycare, and i worked really",0
"well, you should ask him questions in detail about the foreign policy issues our president will confront, because you had better be able to lead our country on the first day. not six months from now, not a year from now, on the first day in office, our president could very well confront a national security crisis. you can't predict it. sometimes you cannot control it. and it is the most -- the federal government does all kinds of things it's not supposed to be doing. it regulates bathrooms. it regulates schools that belong to local communities. but the one thing that the federal government must do, the one thing that only the federal government can do is keep us safe. and a president better be up-to-date on those issues on his first day in office, on her first day in office.",1
"absolutely i can. you know, before it was emails, it was benghazi, and the republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that. and i testified for 11 hours, answered their questions. they basically said yeah, didn't get her. we tried. that was all a political ploy. now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that secretary powell and close aides to former secretary rice used private e-mail accounts. and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to secretary powell and secretary rice's aide they've been doing to me, which is that i never sent or received any classified material. they are retroactively classifying it. i agree completely with secretary powell, who said today this is an absurdity. and so i think the american people will know it's an absurdity. i have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.",0
"i believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis. that's calling it what it is. but john, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our muslim american neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here. they are our first line of defense. and we are going to be able to defeat isis on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the muslim americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion. and now, like never before, we need our muslim american neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.",0
"look, there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion. we need to pay respect to both of them. the first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms. and we have done not a good job on that. a lot of them are criminals. and a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas. and a lot of them are mentally incapacitated. and the shooting in virginia tech in '07, this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information. so we do need background checks. we need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them. but we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.",0

"there's a broader issue here, hugh. and there's a broader issue here as well. first of all, the only people that follow the law are law-abiding people. criminals by definition ignore the law, so you can pass all the gun laws in the world, like the left wants. the criminals are going to ignore it because they are criminals. here's the real issue.",1
"alright. much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class. in fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals. mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well. it shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut. if you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut. mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and i think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.",1
"here is where we are with public education. a 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms. like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education. and that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade. the world has changed. this is 2016. in many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago. so, yes, i do believe that when we talk about public education in america, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities. that should be a right of all americans regardless of the income of their families.",0
"i very much appreciate that comment, bernie. it really is important that we go forward on this. i know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen. obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- i said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us. and so, now that, i think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on. because i don't think the american people are all that interested in this.",0
"hey, wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this. look, we're all in agreement that the japanese need to do more. we're all in agreement that the europeans need to do more, but i hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job. there is no question about it. but, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military. look, i have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense. we need to rebuild our defenses, but, i must also tell you, a long time reformer of the pentagon, we must reform that building.",1
"judgment, strength, clarity and trust. barack obama has said he doesn't believe in american leadership or america winning -- he is wrong. america can win again and we will win again. ronald reagan reignited the american economy, rebuilt the military, bankrupted the soviet union and defeated soviet communism. i will do the same thing. cutting taxes, cutting regulation, unleashing small businesses and rebuilding the military to defeat radical islamic terrorism -- our strategy is simple. we win, they lose. we've done it before and we can do it again.",1
"... let me respond to what the secretary said. we have a criminal justice system which is broken. who in america is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, including china? disproportionately african american, and latino. who is satisfied that 51% of african american young people are either unemployed, or underemployed? who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the ceo's of wall street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records.",0
"that's what i'm telling you. now i don't want -- because i'm not contradicting what i told you in the interview. asylum is a particular legal process. i'd like to see it changed. i'd like to see us give more support to people who come fleeing the terrible violence that they do. but under our law, we have a process we have to go through which is different.",0
"the most important job i'm ever going to have, the most important job anyone in this room will ever have, is the job of being a parent. not the job of being president, or the job of being a senator, or the job of being a congressman. the most important job any of us will ever do is the job of being a president , because the most important institution in society is the family. if the family breaks down, society breaks down. you can't have a strong nation without strong values, and no one is born with strong values. they have to be taught to you in strong families and reinforced in you in strong communities. and so when we set out to do tax reform, we endeavor to have a pro-family tax code, and we endeavor to do it because we know how difficult it is for families in the 21st century to afford the cost of living. it is expensive to raise children in the 21st century, and families that are raising children are raising the future taxpayers of the united states, and everything costs more. in 35 out of 50 states, child care costs more than college. there are millions of people watching this broadcast tonight that understand exactly what i'm talking about. they don't know how they're going to make that payment every month, and if they can't make it, they can't work, because someone needs to watch their kids during the day. they don't know how they're going to save for their kids' future, to go to college. and so, yes, i have a child tax credit increase, and i'm proud of it. i am proud that i have a pro-family tax code, because the pro- family tax plan i have will strengthen the most important institution in the -- in the country, the family.",1
"well, the abuse of the h1-b program has been rampant. on the face of that h1-b abuse, i have proposed, and promised as president that i will impose a 180 day moratorium on the h1b program to implement a comprehensive investigation and audit because you got u.s. companies that are firing american workers, bringing in foreign workers, and forcing them to train their replacements. and, i would note that is not dissimilar to what we discovered at the last debate concerning the hotel that donald owns down in florida. down in florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers, and afterwards it was really striking. i watched the cnn interview donald did where he explained, he said, well the problem is you can't find americans who are qualified, or who want to work as waiters and waitresses. now, let me ask the people here, how many people have worked as a waiter or waitress?",1

"well, look, i believe that we've made great progress as a country with the affordable care act. we've been struggling to get this done since harry truman. and it was not only a great accomplishment of the democratic party, but of president obama. i do think that it's important to defend it. the republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times. they would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now. i want to build on and improve the affordable care act. i would certainly tackle the cost issues, because i think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down. but i think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that i have with senator sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone. and it's-- it's a worthy debate. it's an important one that we should be engaged in.",0
"i don't -- well, i don't know how high it goes. i would certainly be launching an investigation. i think there is one. i was told that -- you know, some of the higher-ups were pushing to get changes that were not happening. so i would have a full investigation, determine who knew what, when. and yes, people should be fired. how far up it went, i don't know. but as far as it goes, they should be relieved, because they failed this city. but let me just add this, anderson. this is not the only place where this kind of action is needed. we have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate.",0
"where secretary clinton and i think, i agree with most of what she said. but where i think we do have an honest disagreement, is that in the incredible quagmire of syria, where it's hard to know who's fighting who and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in isis' hand the next day. we all know that. and we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right, assad is a butcher of his own people, man using chemical weapons against his own people. this is beyond disgusting. but i think in terms of our priorities in the region, our first priority must be the destruction of isis. our second priority must be getting rid of assad, through some political settlement, working with iran, working with russia. but the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy isis, including russia, including iran, including our muslim allies to make that the major priority.",0
"well, i think we have to focus, hugh, on exactly what the priorities are. and to me, what i've always said is that the president has set up an awful situation through his deal with iran, because what his deal with iran has done is empower them and enrich them. and that's the way isis has been created and formed here. isis is created and formed because of the abuse that assad and his iranian sponsors have rained down on the sunnis in syria. and so when we empower iran, this is why this president -- and when hillary clinton says her theory against isis will be just about the same as the president, then get ready for more unrest and more murder and more violence in the middle east. we need to focus our attention on iran, because if you miss iran, you are not going to get isis. the two are inextricably connected because one causes the other.",1
"well, i have what i call the new college compact. because i think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know. number one, states have been dis-investing in higher education. in fact, i think new hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country. so states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education. so under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system. secondly, i don't believe in free tuition for everybody. i believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead. so i have proposed debt free tuition, which i think is affordable and i would move a lot of the pell grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense. so i put all of this together, again, on my website and i've gotten such a good response. but i want to quickly say, one of the areas that senator sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems. free college, a single payer system for health--and it's been estimated we're looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget. and i have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run. and i think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that i have proposed i will tell you exactly how i'm going to pay for it; including college.",0

"but here is the point. my program, making public colleges and universities tuition free, allowing people with debt to refinance at the lowest possible interest rates is a fairly expensive proposal, about $70 billion a year. you know how i'm going to pay for it? i'm going to pay for it by imposing a tax on wall street speculation.",0
"well, first of all, let me just add my praise to justice scalia. i first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago. a tremendous wit and intellect. as far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and i believe that the constitution protects all of our rights. and it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else. but what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights. so nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it. that's unfair. and this is the responsibility of congress to come back and correct what the supreme court has done. that's why we have divided government. and we're going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom. and as president, i would go through and i would look at what a person's life has been. what have they done in the past? what kind of judgments have they made? what kind of associations do they have? that will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you. the fruit salad of their life is what i will look at.",1

"well, hugh, i agree with you that it -- justice scalia's passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election. justice scalia was someone i knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend. and with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance. we are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the second amendment right to keep and bear arms from the constitution. now, i think the voters of texas, the voters across super tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this -- this stage. in the past, republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists. so i'm certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that. but the reality is, democrats bat about 1,000. just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want. republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster. i've spent my whole life fighting to defend the bill of rights and the constitution. i can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the second amendment, they're asking the question: who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court? i give you my word, every justice i nominate will vigorously defend the bill of rights for my children and for yours.",1

"yeah. immigration is not an issue that i read about in the newspaper or watch a documentary on pbs or cnn. it's an issues i've lived around my whole life. my family are immigrants. my wife's family are immigrants. all of my neighbors are immigrants. i see every aspect of this problem. the good, the bad, and the ugly. and here's what we learned in 2013. the american people don't trust the federal government to enforce our immigration laws, and we will not be able to do anything on immigration until we first prove to the american people that illegal immigration is under control. and we can do that. we know what it takes to do that. it takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. it takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. it takes a mandatory e-verify system and a mandatory entry/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. after we have done that, the second thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal immigration system. and after we have done those two things, i think the american people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn't otherwise violated our laws -- because if they're a criminal they can't stay. they'll have to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. and ultimately, they'll given a work permit and that's all they're gonna be allowed to have for at least 10 years. but you can't get to that third step until you have done the other two things, and that was the lesson we learned in 2013. there is no trust that the federal government will enforce the law. they will not support you until you see it done first.",1

"well, states -- if states want to do it, they ought to sit down with businesspeople and the lawmakers and figure out what will work. but hold on a second here with everything else. i'm the only person on this stage who actually was the chief architect of balancing the federal budget. it's not a theory for me. it's not -- it's not some -- you have to know how to put everything together. and you know, i spent 10 years of my life to get there, and i did not do that because i'm worshiping at some balanced budget shrine. the reason i did it is when you have commonsense regulations, lower taxes on individuals and businesses, and you have a fiscal plan that makes sense, the job creators will expand employment. and what happened? when i was there, the jobs were exploding. bill clinton's tried to take credit for it. when i went to ohio, we're up 400,000 jobs. it's the same formula. but it isn't easy. i fought the entire washington establishment and won, because when you balance a budget, you must affect every single thing. everything in the federal government specifically. you cannot get there with theories or broad statements, and you have to be willing to take the heat. in fact, i fought a republican president, who i thought was not offering constructive proposals to fix this economy. so when we talk about all this, there's one person on this stage and one person who's been a candidate for president in either party that restored economic strength, growth, a balanced budget, paid down debt, cut taxes, the things that people in this country want. no theories. reality.",1
"look, i am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in america, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths. people with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived. this is a remarkable and horrifying fact. and that's why i've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal. you know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us? do people not care about all of our sacrifice? and i'm going to do everything i can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country. i particularly appreciate the proposal that congressman jim clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. and you know what? if you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out. so, yes, i do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is. and that's why, as president, i will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.",0

"well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again. if you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again. the second thing i said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms. for example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days. you also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor. but here's the best solution of all. we need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century. why, for the life of me, i do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in america, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work. but the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so americans have the skills for those jobs. but in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers to canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here. but the ideal scenario is to train americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.",1

"no. i just will tell you that, you know, jeb made the statement. i'm not only referring to him. i -- a lot of money was raised by a lot of different people that are standing up here. and the donors, the special interests, the lobbyists have very strong power over these people. i'm spending all of my money, i'm not spending -- i'm not getting any -- i turned down -- i turn down so much, i could have right now from special interests and donors, i could have double and triple what he's got. i've turned it down. i turned down last week $5 million from somebody. so i will tell you i understand the game, i've been on the other side all of my life. and they have a lot of control over our politicians. and i don't say that favorably, and i'm not sure if there's another system, but i say this. i am not accepting any money from anybody. nobody has control of me other than the people of this country. i'm going to do the right thing.",1

"first of all, i've been talking about this for over a year. we have to destroy their caliphate because that gives them legitimacy to go ahead with the global jihad. we have to take their energy because they are -- isis is the richest terrorist organization there is. we have to take their oil, shut down all of the mechanisms whereby they can disperse money because they go after disaffected individuals from all over the place, and they're able to pay them. that makes a difference. as far as the command centers are concerned in raqqa and to a lesser degree mosul, cut those off. do the same kind of thing that we did with sinjar a few weeks ago, working with our embedded special forces with the kurds, shut off the supply route, soften them up, then we go in with specials ops followed by our air force to take them over. those are things that work. but also, you know, this whole concept of boots on the ground, you know, we've got a phobia about boots on the ground. if our military experts say, we need boots on the ground, we should put boots on the ground and recognize that there will be boots on the ground and they'll be over here, and they'll be their boots if we don't get out of there now.",1

"martha, thank you. tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign america has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, american lives taken from us. so, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the united states is to protect the people of the united states. i visited with a number of our neighbors in northern virginia at a mosque last friday. and as i looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, i also looked in the eyes of veterans. i looked into the eyes of boy scouts. i looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms. what our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger. and that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other. what our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as americans. we will rise to challenge of isil and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy. but we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths. we are a better country than this. our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the statue of liberty. and america's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.",0

"i called for those changes. i have been on the record and now i do have the toughest, most comprehensive plan to go after wall street. and not just the big banks, all the other financial interests that pose a threat to our economy. and i have said no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail, and i will use the powers that have now been passed by the congress, by president obama, who, incidentally, took a lot of money from wall street, which didn't stop him from signing into law the toughest regulations on the financial industry since the great depression.",0
"ok, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the naleo, the national association for latino elected officials, i was the only one of 17 republican candidates to go there. and the reason that i don't fear going to an organization like that is because the message that i give is the same message to every group. you know, this is america. and we need to have policies that are -- that give liberty and justice to all people. and that's the way that i have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that. and i think that's the way the republican party generally thinks. we don't pick and choose winners and losers. we are compassionate. but real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of america. when we begin to emphasize that, i think we will attract everybody.",1

"and what we have right now is we have washington -- as government gets bigger and bigger, you know, the biggest lie in all of washington and in all of politics is that republicans are the party of the rich. the truth is, the rich do great with big government. they get in bed with big government. the big banks get bigger and bigger and bigger under dodd-frank and community banks are going out of business. and, by the way, the consequence of that is small businesses can't get business loans, and it is that fundamental corruption that is why six of the 10 wealthiest counties in america are in and around washington, d.c. and let me give you a contrast to washington cronyism. some weeks ago, a woman named sabina loving testified at a hearing that i chaired in the senate. sabina loving is an african-american single mom who started a tax preparation business in the south side of chicago. she found a store front, she wanted to have her own business. she started a business. but then the irs promulgated new regulations targeting tax preparers. they did it under a more than 100-year-old statute called the dead horse act. now, this statute and the irs in classic washington crony fashion had exemptions for lawyers and big fancy accountants, but sabina had to pay $1,000 an employee. it would have driven her out of business, and ms. loving sued the irs. she took the obama irs to court, and she won, and they struck down the rule for picking the big guys over the little guys.",1

"i don't at this point in terms of changing the incentives for investment and risk-taking. but let's just stop for a second. there's one person on this stage that does have a record. i'm the only person on the stage and one of the few people in this country that led the effort as the chief architect of the last time we balanced the federal budget. we also cut taxes. and when i left washington in 2000, we had a $5 trillion surplus, and the economy was booming. i had spent 10 years of my life to get us to that point, went out in the private sector, was a great experience, and went into ohio and took an $8 billion hole and turned it into a $2 billion surplus. we've had the largest amount of tax cuts of any sitting governor. we've grown well over 300,000 jobs. you see, i've done it in both places. i'm the only one here that has done it in both places. it took a lot to get us to a balanced budget. it was legitimate. it was real. and we negotiated it. a lot of what we're talking about here tonight as we take this position and that position, you know what? at the end of the day, america has got to work. we've got to figure out how we come together to deal with this -- with our fiscal problems because when we deal with that, we create a stronger economy for everybody. people have a chance to rise. so, you know, when we think about how we make a choice, it's the person that lands that plane. it's not somebody that talks about it. it's about the person who has done it. and i've done it in...",1
"well, i'm going to respond to that, because i think it's a very important issue. and by the way, everybody, who, quote, ""got money"" in the quote, ""bailout"", that also included money for the auto rescue has paid it back. so, the treasury was out nothing. now that will no longer happen because we have dodd-frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy.",0

"no, i wouldn't. and -- but that doesn't matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions. you don't want any american to lose their house, everything they've saved, because they get sick. now, i think it is more complicated than what we've heard here tonight. we're actually running significant health reform in my state. i would repeal obamacare for a variety of reasons. i would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up medicaid program, which i would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don't want to have tens of millions of americans losing their health insurance. and then we're driving towards total transparency. if any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it's easier to interpret the dead sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill. the fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers. and i'll tell you what we will do. we are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices. we actually are going to make the market work.",1

"actually that's incorrect. there are two different agreements. there's tpa and tpp. i opposed tpp and have always opposed tpp, which is what you asked about. and when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps americans. but we're getting killed in international trade right now. and we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for american workers and jobs are going overseas. we're driving jobs overseas. and the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. but i'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. this obama administration is negotiating the trade in services agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from americans as well. and you've got to understand. trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. so the question is, what's the solution? it's easy to talk about the problems. but do you have a solution to fix it? and i think the solution is several things. number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting american workers first, not the corporate board room. number two, we need to lift the regulations on american businesses here so we see jobs coming back. and number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan i've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to america.",1
"well, first of all i am looking at your daughter and i'm very grateful that she is laughing and she is on a road to recovery. but it never should have happened. you know, on average, 90 people a day are killed by gun violence in our country. i think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms. the brady bill, which has been in effect now for about 23 years, has kept more than two million purchases from going forward. so we do have to continue to try to work on that because not every killer will have the same profile. but the comprehensive background checks, closing the gun show loophole, closing the online loophole, closing what's called the charleston loophole, where you get a gun at the end of three days, even if the background check is not completed which is what the killer in charleston did. and then they found out later, he shouldn't have gotten the gun when he killed nine people at mother emmanuel church. i also believe, so strongly gene, that giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers was a terrible mistake.",0
"let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with secretary clinton here. when you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the gdp of america, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, i think if teddy roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up. i think he would have been right. i think he would have said bring back a 21st-century glass-steagall legislation. i think that would have been right, as well. that's my view.",0
"well, first of all, rand paul shouldn't even be on this stage. he's number 11, he's got 1 percent in the polls, and how he got up here, there's far too many people anyway. as far as temperament -- and we all know that -- as far as temperament, i think i have a great temperament. i built a phenomenal business with incredible, iconic assets, one of the really truly great real-estate businesses. and i may be an entertainer, because i've had tremendous success with number-one bestsellers all over the place, with ""the apprentice"" and everything else i've done. but i will tell you this: what i am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman, and that's the kind of mindset this country needs to bring it back, because we owe $19 trillion right now, $19 trillion, and you need this kind of thinking to bring our country back. and believe me, my temperament is very good, very calm. but we will be respected outside of this country. we are not respected now.",1
"well, don't, let me say this, senator sanders voted for that bill, we both supported it. and, i think it's fair to say we did because back then there was an outcry over the rising crime rate, and people from all communities were asking that action be taken. now, my husband said at the naacp last summer that it solved some problems, but it created other problems, and i agree. and, one of those problems was, unfortunately, a move to expand the reasons why people would be incarcerated, not just at the federal level which is what this bill about, but in states and localities as well. and, that's why the very first speech that i gave in this campaign was about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration because i believe absolutely that too many families were broken up, too many communities were adversely affected. so, we've got to do a bunch of things. on the criminal justice side, look, we've got to have better policing. that means body cameras, that means ending profiling, that means doing everything we can to make sure there's respect between the community and the police. and, when it comes to incarceration...",0

"here's what i believe. i believe we're at the verge of the greatest time to be alive in this world. but washington is holding us back. how we tax, how we regulate. we're not embracing the energy revolution in our midst, a broken immigration system that has been politicized rather than turning it into an economic driver. we're not protecting and preserving our entitlement system or reforming for the next generation. all these things languish while we have politicians in washington using these as wedge issues. here's my commitment to you, because i did it as florida. we can fix these things. we can grow economically and restore america's leadership in the world, so that everybody has a chance to rise up. i humbly ask for your vote, whenever you're gonna get to vote, whenever the primary is. thank you all very much.",1

"and tonight i am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead, starting with the economic ones. my focus is on more good paying jobs with rising incomes for families and how we prevent corporations from taking jobs out of our country by imposing an exit tax, making them pay back any tax breaks they've gotten. but we also need to be having a positive agenda for manufacturing. for small businesses and entrepreneurs, for more clean energy jobs. and i also look forward to discussing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that will be one of my priorities in my first 100 days as president. and i will also be talking about education, every child deserves a good teacher and a good school.",0
"david, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees. i met recently with some members of the chaldean christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months. there is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through. we need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.",0
"what my bill would do would be only for refugees going forward. so i haven't taken a position on sending anyone home. but i have taken the position that we have a lot of problems here in our country. and that one of the things that we do -- charity is about giving your own money. charity isn't giving someone else's money. to put everyone in government housing and food stamps and bring them in from around the world i think is a mistake. to give of your own money, i've given to my church. my church has helped people that came from bosnia. that's a good thing. but we shouldn't have a program where we just say that we're going to take care of the world's refugees. nobody in the middle east is doing anything. saudi arabia, qatar, kuwait -- all the gulf nations are doing nothing. they need to step up and",1
"well, secretary clinton, you're not in the white house yet. and let us be clear that every proposal that i have introduced has been paid for. for example, all right, who in america denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling? roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that? who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent? who denies that african-american youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent. we need to create jobs. so yes, i will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the cayman islands and bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax. yes, i'm going to do away with that. we will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure. yes, i believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on wall street, that they are a wall street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the great recession -- great depression. yes, i do believe that now after the american people bailed wall street out, yes, they should pay a wall street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. we bailed them out. now it is their time to help the middle class.",0

"well, i think that there are different records. i -- you know, know that senator sanders had a different vote than i did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers. that was a terrible mistake. it basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in washington but across the country. but just think about this-- since we last debated in las vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns. twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in des moins where three were murdered. two hundred children have been killed. this is an emergency. there are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in wall street is certainly one of them. i agree with that. that's why i've got such a good plan. but we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of americans agree we should have universal background checks. close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...",0
"well, first, let me say i think i have the most comprehensive plan to combat climate change. it sets some very big goals, a half billion more solar panels deployed by the end of my first term, if i'm so fortunate to be president. and enough clean energy to power every home by the end of my second term. what i am looking at is how we make the transition from where we are today to where are today to where we must be. i worked with president obama during the four years i was secretary of state to begin to put pressure on china and india and other countries to join with us to have a global agreement which we finally got in paris. so i am committed to and focused on how we make that transition. i've already said we are taking away the subsidies for oil and gas, but it is important that people understand that a president can't go ordering folks around. our system doesn't permit that. i am going to set the goals. i will push everybody as hard as i can to achieve those goals. we will make progress on clean renewable energy and create millions of jobs through that.",0
"maria, neil, thank you for a great tonight. when i think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and i think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the house of representatives, with the president of the united states, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling. they know that this country is not respected around the world anymore. they know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it. i love this country. it's the most exceptional country the world has ever known. we need someone to fight for the people. we need a fighter for this country again. i've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that i believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests. but here's the best way that we're going to make america much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in september who will fight hillary clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the white house again. i am the man who can bring us together to do that, and i ask for your vote.",1

"absolutely. that was a very arbitrary decision. what that real debate was about, as you may or may not know, was about how long it would take for the instant background check to go into effect. i wanted that instant background check to go into effect as soon as possible. that was the most important part of that bill.",0

"look, first of all, i wrote a book about this, three -- four years ago, now. and i laid out a comprehensive, conservative approach for immigration reform. and it does require securing the border. no one disagrees with that. but to build a wall, and to deport people -- half a million a month -- would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, donald. hundreds of billions of dollars. it would destroy community life, it would tear families apart. and it would send a signal to the rest of the world that the united states values that are so important for our long-term success no longer matter in this country.",1

"no, i don't think so, but we need to be strong against china. we should use offensive tactics as it relates to cyber security, send a deterrent signal to china. there should be super sanctions in what president obama has proposed. there's many other tools that we have without canceling a dinner. that's not going to change anything, but we can be much stronger as it relates to that. as it relates to iran, it's not a strategy to tear up an agreement. a strategy would be how do we confront iran? and, the first thing that we need to do is to establish our commitment to israel which has been altered by this administration. and, make sure that they have the most sophisticated weapons to send a signal to iran that we have israel's back. if we do that, it's going to create a healthier deterrent effect than anything else i can think of.",1

"my plan is not amnesty for a number of reasons. number one, you know, i've talked to farmers, and they said they cannot hire americans to do the kind of job that i'm talking about. and the second reason is because the individuals who register as guest workers, they don't get to vote, they are not american citizens, and they don't get the rights and privileges of american citizens. so that's key. but the other thing that i want to bring up is, i mentioned something earlier. i think it was just sort of glossed over. i talked about the success in yuma county, i mean, incredible success, and the department of justice said, ""no, we don't want to do that. that's too successful."" we don't have to keep reinventing the wheel. all we have to do is look at things that work. all we have to do is use a little common sense.",1

"no one is tearing this up, we're going to go forward. but with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles. tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the british, who guarantee health care to all of their people? fifty percent more than the french, more than the canadians. the vision from fdr and harry truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way. we're not going to tear up the affordable care act. i helped write it. but we are going to move on top of that to a medicaid-for-all system.",0

"the way you bring manufacturing back to america is, number one, you lift the regulations. as president, i will repeal obamacare, the biggest job-killer in america. i will pull back the federal regulators, the epa and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing. and my tax plan, which is a very, very detailed plan on the website, tedcruz.org, is what's called border adjustable. we get rid of all the taxes. we get rid of the corporate income tax and the death tax and the obamacare taxes and the payroll tax. and we replace it with a 16 percent business flat tax that is border adjustable, which means all exports are entirely tax-free and all imports pay the 16 percent business flat tax. that's a 32 percent differential. what that will do, chris, is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country, bring the steel industry back to this country, create an environment where when we compete on a fair and level playing field, american ingenuity can beat anyone. but right now, the federal government isn't giving us a level playing field.",1
"so they soybean sales from iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to china. or how about boeing right here within a mile? do you think that the chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying airbus? of course, they would. this would be devastating for the economy. we need someone with a steady hand being president of the united states.",1
"well, i think secretary clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. i have a d-minus voting record from the nra. i was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of vermont, i stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons. i have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns. and that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. i support what president obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and i think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant. we have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people. this should not be a political issue. what we should be doing is working together. and by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, i believe that i am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...",0

"well, there is no question. i mean, it really is an outrage. and it just continues, the seven-and-a-half years of unbelievable obstructionism we have seen from these right-wing republicans. i mean, a third-grader in america understands the president of the united states has the right to nominate individuals to the u.s. supreme court. apparently everybody understands that except the republicans in congress.",0

"... do you know that in 1960 detroit michigan was one of the wealthiest cities in america? flint, michigan was a prosperous city, but then what happened is corporate america said why do i want to pay somebody in michigan a living wage when i can pay slave wages in mexico or china? we're going to shut down, we're going to move abroad, we're going to bring those products back into this country. those trade policies, as much as any other set of policies, has resulted in the shrinking of the american middle class. and, i'll tell you what else it did. it's not only job loss by the millions, it is the race to the bottom so that new jobs in manufacturing, in some cases today, pay 50 percent less than they did 20 years ago. how stupid is that trade policy?",0

"well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. but let me just say this. in terms of where we are right now, as you mention, rachel, in a number of national and state, including new hampshire. for example, the last poll i saw -- there may have been a new one -- last one i saw here in new hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. there were also pretty large margins in iowa and wisconsin. these are polls. polls go up. polls go down. but here's why i think i will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process. republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. i believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout. if there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the white house, but i think we regain the senate. we win governors' chairs up and down the line. so i believe if you want to retain the white house, if you want to see democrats do well across the board, i think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.",0
"(inaudible), the great majority of republicans and americans believe in a hopeful future. they don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future. they're concerned that washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back. there are lids on people's aspirations. think about it: six and a half million people working part-time. workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977. six million more people living in poverty than the day that barack obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same. we have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which i've laid out. and you can go get it at jeb2016.com.",1

"vladimir putin is exploiting that weakness, for purposes of edging the americans out as the most important geopolitical power broker in the region. and we do have a vested interest. and here's why. because all those radical terrorist groups that, by the way, are not just in syria and in iraq, isis is now in libya. they are a significant presence in libya, and in afghanistan, and a growing presence in pakistan. soon they will be in turkey. they will try jordan. they will try saudi arabia. they are coming to us. they recruit americans using social media. and they don't hate us simply because we support israel. they hate us because of our values. they hate us because our girls go to school. they hate us because women drive in the united states. either they win or we win, and we had better take this risk seriously, it is not going away on its own.",1

"no, listen. this is an issue that -- that we've gotta talk about, and we haven't talked about yet. 71 percent of all federal spending is on entitlements and debt service. when john kennedy was elected president in 1960, it was 26 percent. harvard and dartmouth says that social security's going to go insolvent in seven to eight years. so what i say is very simple. we need to save this program for the good people out there who have paid into the system and need it. and if that means making sure that folks like donald and many of us on the stage don't get it, that's the right thing to do because here's what hillary clinton is going to want to do. she's going to want to put more money into a system that has already lied to us and stolen from us. this government doesn't need more money to make social security solvent. we need to be not paying out benefits to people who don't really need it. we need to protect the people who social security means the difference between picking between heat and rent and food. that's why i put out the proposal and that's the people i'm trying",1
"well, first of all, when we talk about the import export bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare. if we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well. secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive. our wages are growing faster than the national average, and i've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax. i want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in washington. this is the same old stuff since i left. you spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow. i don't know if people understand, but i spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget. we actually did it. and i have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance. reforming entitlements, cutting taxes. you see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy. so what i will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose. and you know what? ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- i not only did it in washington, i did it in ohio, and i'll go back to washington, and there will be no more silly deals...",1
"well, what we have to stop and think about is that we have weakened ourselves militarily to such an extent that if affects all of our military policies. our navy is at its smallest size since 1917; our air force, since 1940. in recent testimony, the commandant of the marine corps said half of the non-deployed units were not ready and you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel. our generals are retiring because they don't want to be part of this, and at the same time, our enemies are increasing. our -- our friends can't trust us anymore. you know, ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. they gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them. we won't even give them offensive weapons. you know, we turned our back on israel, our ally. you know, in a situation like that, of course obama's not going to be able to do anything. i would shore up our military first, because if you don't get the military right, nothing else is going to work.",1

"look we have a law -- look, you know, i -- i appreciate the senator's advocacy. we have a law. it was passed. it was signed by president obama. it lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed. and by the way, president obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from wall street, because he's a responsible president. so we have a law in place. if the circumstances warrant it, i will certainly use it. and from what you say, i know you will as well. but that is not enough. and i keep going back to this because part of the reason the wall street guys are trying so hard to stop me -- the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys -- is because i've got their number on all of that. and my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future. you know, we can't just fight the last war. we've got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many americans. and my plan, paul krugman, barney frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said i am exactly on point, and the wall street guys actually know that.",0

"thank you. you know, people are disgusted with the way that money has corrupted our political process, intimidating incumbents and empowering wall street every day, the turnstile government that we see, and also the power of the financial sector in both parties. they're looking for a leader who understands how the system works, who has not been coopted by it, and also has a proven record of accomplishing different things. i have a record of working across the political aisle. i've also spent more than half of my professional life away from politics in the independent world of being an author, a journalist, and a sole proprietor. in government service, i've fought and bled for our country in vietnam as a marine. i spent years as assistant secretary of defense, secretary of the navy -- in the reagan administration. in the senate, i spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one. i also wrote and passed the best piece of veterans education legislation in history, the post 9/11 g.i. bill. i brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion. i led what later became called the strategic pivot to asia two years before president obama was elected. i know where my loyalties are. my mother grew up in the poverty of east arkansas chopping cotton, picking strawberries. three of her seven siblings died in childhood. my wife, hong, came to this country as a refugee from war torn vietnam -- learned english, a language that was not spoken at home, and earned her way into cornell law school. i have five daughters. amy works with disabled veterans, sarah is an emergency room nurse, julia is a massage therapist, emily and georgia are still in school. my son jim fought as an infantry marine on the bloody streets of ramadi. you may be sure that in a webb administration, the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home, and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common sense foreign policy.",0
"and actually, under the current circumstances, kids who had privilege like you do, don't go to jail, but the poor kids in our inner cities go to jail. i don't think that's fair. and i think we need to acknowledge it, and it is hypocritical to still want to put poor people in jail...",1
"you know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country -- our millions of americans who are losing their jobs. millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down. you know, in the past couple of weeks the wall street journal had a very interesting article about the state of arizona. arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and what's happened there -- it was a very interesting article. some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. but, what the state of arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars. and, the americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise. that's who we need to be fighting for. listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but i think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become u.s. citizens, and that's why i've led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and that's why i will do the same thing as president.",1
"wait, megyn, the court has ruled, and i said we'll accept it. and guess what, i just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. because somebody doesn't think the way i do, doesn't mean that i can't care about them or can't love them. so if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course i would love them and i would accept them. because you know what?",1
"thank you very much. i've been looking forward to this debate, and i want to thank univision, the washington post, facebook and miami-dade college, the largest college in north america for hosting us here this evening.",0
"well, david, i think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country. we have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended. i feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect. trust has been totally lost in a lot of places. at the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically. the young officer who was killed responding to the planned parenthood murders. the officer who told the victims of the san bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them. so i think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that president obama impaneled. we need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this. and we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.",0
"let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country. and i will tell you something that really galls me. i will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy. just a little bit. all over this country we have republican candidates for president saying we hate the government. government is the enemy. we're going to cut social security to help you. we're going to cut medicare and medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible. but, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in america. if that's not hypocrisy, i don't know what hypocrisy is.",0
"thank you. thank -- thank -- thank you very much. you know, it's interesting -- donald went -- went on -- on an extended tirade about the polls, but he didn't respond to any of the substance. he has yet to say -- he can release past year's tax returns. he can do it tomorrow. he doesn't want to do it, because presumably there's something in there...",1
"and, i am building a broad, diverse coalition across our country. i'm very excited by the support we're receiving. i have said, and i'll repeat here, i think that donald trump's bigotry, his bullying, his bluster, are not going to wear well on the american people.",0
"no. i mean, of course that's a theoretical question, and we don't know what it would be for, and we don't know how many numbers there are. i am against american combat troops being in syria and iraq. i support special forces. i support trainers. i support the air campaign. and i think we're making some progress. i want to continue to intensify that, and that's exactly what the president is doing.",0
"well, let me just answer that. what that was about was saying that the united states was wrong to try to invade cuba, that the united states was wrong trying to support people to overthrow the nicaraguan government, that the united states was wrong trying to overthrow in 1954, the government -- democratically elected government of guatemala. throughout the history of our relationship with latin america we've operated under the so-called monroe doctrine, and that said the united states had the right do anything that they wanted to do in latin america. so i actually went to nicaragua and i very shortly opposed the reagan administration's efforts to overthrow that government. and i strongly opposed earlier henry kissinger and the -- to overthrow the government of salvador aliende in chile. i think the united states should be working with governments around the world, not get involved in regime change. and all of these actions, by the way, in latin america, brought forth a lot of very strong anti-american sentiments. that's what that was about.",0
"well, i would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren't actually workers at all. they are just coming in primarily based on family connection. and ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, i acknowledge that my parents came to the u.s. on a family-based system. the problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago. the 21st century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills. when my parents came, they had a very limited education. my father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. and he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. and i'm grateful every day that america welcomed them. but today in the 21st century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don't have skills is very difficult. we need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on h-1b, particularly on green cards. the primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st century should be, what skills do you have? what business are you going to open? what investment are you going to make? what job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the united states?",1
"well, if the law would change, yeah. but i think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the united states. and what we want to do is to control this. we also want to dominate this from a commercial side. so there's a lot of balanced interests. but the president leads in this regard. that's what we need. we need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.",1
"well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business. for example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for medicare to negotiate for lower prices. in fact, american consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the national institute of health and that we then tested through the fda. so there's more to my plan than just the cap. we have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get medicare the authority to negotiate.",0
"i was not at all critical of him. i was not at all. in fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people. they go to harvard. they go to yale. they go to princeton. they come from another country and they're immediately sent out. i am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in silicon valley.",1
"well you know, rachel, i think i may not have done the job i should in explaining my record. you know, i did -- when i left the secretary of state's office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, i did go on the speaking circuit. i spoke to heart doctors, i spoke to the american camping association, i spoke to auto dealers, and yes, i spoke to firms on wall street. they wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of state. but what i want people to know is i went to wall street before the crash. i was the one saying you're going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. i called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. i proposed changes in ceo compensation. i called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created. and i think the best evidence that the wall street people at least know where i stand and where i have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary. they have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. hedge fund billionaires, karl rove, another billionaire, jumped in. and why are they doing that? these are guys who try to make smart investments. they know my record, they know me, they know that i say what i believe and i will do it. and i also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them. so i do want people to know that, and i think it's important for everybody to understand i have a record, i have stood firm and i will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again.",0
"because i think it is incredibly important. this is really about the survival of western civilization. this is not just a little conflict with a middle eastern country that we've just now given over $100 billion to, the equivalent in u.s. terms is $5 trillion. this threatens israel immediately, this threatens the entire middle east, but it threatens the united states of america. and we can't treat a nuclear iranian government as if it is just some government that would like to have power. this is a government for 36 years has killed americans, they kidnapped americans, they have maimed americans. they have sponsored terrorist groups, hamas and hezbollah, and they threaten the very essence of western civilization. to give them this agreement, that the president treats like the magna carta, but iranians treat it like it's toilet paper, and we must, simply, make it very clear that the next president, one of us on this stage, will absolutely not honor that agreement, and will destroy it and will be tough with iran, because otherwise, we put every person in this world in a very dangerous place.",1

"and as president, what i will do for seniors, for anyone at or near retirement, there will be no changes whatsoever. every benefit will be protected to the letter. but for younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. and as you noted dinan, we need to have for younger workers, that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts, like the 401(k), that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids.",1
"well, i thought we had been hearing quite a bit about govenor christie's record as governor, actually. i think track records are very important. i completely agree that what's at stake here is the future of this nation, and the future of every american. but i do think that a track record of leadership is vital because in the end this election is about leadership. and let's talk about what leadership is. it's not about braggadocio, it is about challenging the status quo, solving problems, producing results. and the highest calling of leadership is to unlock potential in others.",1
"let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed. this nation is the most powerful military in the world. we're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism. we are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons. i think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us. the cold war is over. and our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets. so, in terms of refugees, i believe that the united states has the moral responsibility with europe, with gulf countries like saudi arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like afghanistan and syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out. now, what the magic number is, i don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem. but i certainly think that the united states should take its full responsibility in helping those people.",0

"well, first of all, i was wrong about taking the oil subsidy. i have studied that issue in great detail. and what i have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are. and -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now. and -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything. the reason that i -- i hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services. that cost gets passed on to the people. now, who are the people who are hurt by that? it's poor people and middle class. doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class. and bernie sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich. well, i'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.",1
"well, first off, i too believe in curriculum reform. it is critically important in the 21st century. we do need curriculum reform. and it should happen at the state and local level. that's. . . that's. . . that is where educational policy belongs, because if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature, or their governor and get it changed. here's the problem with common core. the department of education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied. they will not stop with it being a suggestion. they will turn it into a mandate. in fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it. and they will use common core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states.",1
"and i do think that the bilateral agreement that president obama made with the chinese was significant. now, it needs to go further, and there will be an international meeting at the end of this year, and we must get verifiable commitments to fight climate change from every country gathered there.",0

"including the clean power act. while i do think that man may have a role in our climate, i think nature also has a role. the planet's 4.5 billion years old, we've been through geologic age after geologic age. we've had times when the temperatures been warmer, we've had times when the temperatures been colder. we've had times when the carbon in the atmosphere's been higher. so, i think before we -- we need to look before we leap. president's often fond of saying he wants a balance solution, but, really we do need to balance both keeping the environment clean, and we will have some rules for that. we got to balance that with the economy. he's devastated my state. i say the president's not only destroying kentucky, he's destroying the democrat party down there because nobody wants to associate with him. so, what we really need is somebody that understands that we do need energy of all forms, and that means we will have solar, and wind, and hydro, but we will still have coal, and we still will have natural gas. and, we've got to have an all of the above policy. but, it would be a mistake to shut down all of our industries in the coal fields, and shut down the coal power plants. if we did so we're going to have a day where we wake up and some of our big cities are either very cold, or very hot. so, i think it's a big danger, and we shouldn't do it. and, what we should do is say we want all of the above...",1
"well, first of all, i don't really think that. i think that i hold views that are very similar to many of the people. we are more inclusive. and if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it's, again, the biggest story. you look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening. i am different in one primary respect, and that's trade. i feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals. the jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs. you look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed. so that's that. but i will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country. the devaluations of their currencies by china and japan and many, many other countries, and we don't do it because we don't play the game. and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave. if you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the united states and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs. and if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up. it has gone down. and i think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what i'm saying.",1
"all right. i have said from the very beginning that i supported the fight for $15. i supported those on the front lines of the fight for -- it happens to be true. i also -- i supported the $15 effort in l.a. i supported in seattle. i supported it for the fast food workers in new york. the minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.25, right? we want to raise it higher than it ever has been, but we also have to recognize some states and some cities will go higher, and i support that. i have taken my cue from the democrats in the senate, led by senator patty murray and others, like my good friend kirsten gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it. going from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference. thirty-five million people will get a raise. one in four working mothers will get a raise. i want to get something done. and i think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to $15. but, of course, if we have a democratic congress, we will go to $15.",0

"let's start off with my father being a mailman. so i understand the concerns of all the folks across this country, some of whom have trouble, you know, making ends meet. but i think she will come in a narrow way. the nominee of this party, if they're going to win, has got to come at it in a big way, which is pro-growth. which is balancing budgets. you know, we were talking about it. people were saying, could we do it? i was the chairman of the budget committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in washington, and when we did it we had great economic growth, we cut taxes, and we had a big surplus. economic growth is the key. economic growth is the key to everything. but once you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who don't seem to ever think that they get a fair deal. and that includes people in our minority community; that includes people who feel as though they don't have a chance to move up. you know, america is a miracle country. and we have to restore the sense that the ""amiracle"" will apply to you. each and every one of the people in this country who's watching tonight, lift everybody,",1

"i'm one of the 77 percent. i think this is a very difficult issue. let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said. let me tell you what i think we have got to do. i think it's a two-pronged issue. number one, our goal is to crush and destroy isis. what is the best way to do it? well, i think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself. i voted against the war in iraq because i thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the middle east. i do not believe in unilateral american action. i believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the muslim nations. i think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world; one of the heroes who we should recognize in the middle east is king abdullah ii of jordan. this small country has welcomed in many refugees. and abdullah said something recently, very important. he said, yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of islam. we the muslims should lead the effort on the ground. and i believe he is absolutely right.",0

"listen, i want to talk to the audience at home for a second. if your eyes are glazing over like mine, this is what it's like to be on the floor of the united states senate. i mean, endless debates about how many angels on the head of a pin from people who've never had to make a consequential decision in an executive position. the fact is, for seven years, i had to make these decisions after 9/11, make a decision about how to proceed forward with an investigation or how to pull back, whether you use certain actionable intelligence or whether not to. and yet they continue to debate about this bill and in the subcommittee and what -- nobody in america cares about that. what they care about is, are we going to have a president who actually knows what they're doing to make these decisions? and for the seven years afterwards, new jersey was threatened like no other region in this country and what we did was we took action within the constitution to make sure that law enforcement had all the information they needed. we prosecuted two of the biggest terrorism cases in the world and stopped fort dix from being attacked by six american radicalized muslims from a mosque in new jersey because we worked with the muslim american community to get intelligence and we used the patriot act to get other intelligence to make sure we did those cases. this is the difference between actually been a federal prosecutor, actually doing something, and not just spending your life as one of hundred debating it. let's talk about how we do this, not about which bill, which one these guys like more. the american people don't care about that.",1
"that's a great question. first of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago. it's an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world. now, the big companies that have connections with washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one tania is talking about, they're the ones that are struggling. the first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses. we need to have a regulatory budget in america that limits the amount of regulations on our economy. we need to repeal and replace obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs. and last but not least, we need to repeal dodd-frank. it is eviscerating small businesses and small banks.",1
"nafta, supported by the secretary cost, us 800,000 jobs nationwide, tens of thousands of jobs in the midwest. permanent normal trade relations with china cost us millions of jobs. look, i was on a picket line in early 1990's against nfata because you didn't need a phd in economics to understand that american workers should not be forced to compete against people in mexico making 25 cents an hour.",0
"all right, look, secretary clinton wants everybody else to release it, well, i'm your democratic opponent, i release it, here it is. there ain't nothing. i don't give speeches to wall street for hundreds of thousands of dollars, you got it. second of all, when we talk about being tough on wall street, and this galls me and the american people. recently goldman sachs, among many other major financial institutions on wall street, as you know, reached a settlement with the federal government for $5 billion because they were selling worthless packages of subprime mortgages, $5 billion settlement. you know how many people, executives on wall street have gone to jail? if you are a kid caught with marijuana in michigan, you get a police record. if you are an executive on wall street that destroys the american economy, you pay a $5 billion fine, no police record. if i am elected president, we are going to bring justice back to a broken criminal justice system.",0
"let's talk about the auto bailout because i think it's important for people to understand what happened. in december of 2008, we were both in the senate, there was a vote on a free-standing bill to rescue the auto industry. we both voted for it. was the right vote. unfortunately, it did not succeed. the republicans marshalled the votes against it. a month later, in january, a new piece of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto rescue. then president-elect obama -- before he'd even been sworn in -- sent word to all of us that he really hoped we would support it. he was still in the senate, i was still in the senate. and i voted for it. it was a hard vote. i'll tell you, it was a hard vote. a lot of the votes you make are hard votes. but the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill.",0
"well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling. the democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits. you know, you look at women working. i'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family. my sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms. my mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when i was 3 years old. now, thank god, my father was invited to a bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together. but i -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary. and you know, when you see hillary clinton and bernie sanders and all the democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under barack obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty. not a one of them mentioned the fact that under barack obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733. the the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations. and the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's hispanics. that is who i'm fighting for. the people that washington leaves behind.",1

"well, i was speaking about drug cartels and criminal activity that was very concerning to folks across the country. i think it was a poor choice of words, i never used it before, i haven't used it since, i would not use it again. because my whole life, to go back to what i was saying to mr. mcgee, is, you know, really, ever since i went to work for the children's defense fund, is to try to figure out ways to even the odds for people that are left out and left behind. and i know very well that we have too many kids in our country right now who are living in poverty, who are going to schools like the ones in detroit that have mold and rodents in them. i saw that in south carolina. it's unfortunately across america. so what we have got to do is provide more opportunities earlier in the lives of every child. that's why i believe in supporting families, early childhood education, universal pre-kindergarten, help kids be successful. and here is flint, we've got to do more to mitigate against the effects of lead, because too many kids are having the experiences i've been told about, where they're falling back in school, where they are having headaches because of the lead exposure.",0

"well, putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there, because they -- that's why they're called special ops, they're actually able to guide some of the other things that we're doing there. and what we have to recognize is that putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the middle east. this is going to be his base. and we have to oppose him there in an effective way. we also must recognize that it's a very complex place. you know, the chinese are there, as well as the russians, and you have all kinds of factions there. what we've been doing so far is very ineffective, but we can't give up ground right there. but we have to look at this on a much more global scale. we're talking about global jihadists. and their desire is to destroy us and to destroy our way of life. so we have to be saying, how do we make them look like losers? because that's the way that they're able to gather a lot of influence. and i think in order to make them look like losers, we have to destroy their caliphate. and you look for the easiest place to do that? it would be in iraq. and if -- outside of anbar in iraq, there's a big energy field. take that from them. take all of that land from them. we could do that, i believe, fairly easily, i've learned from talking to several generals, and then you move on from there. but you have to continue to face them, because our goal is not to contain them, but to destroy them before they destroy us.",1

"no, i support free trade deals that are good for america. we're 5 percent of the world's population. if all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. we have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things. the problem is we're a low-tariff country. to import something into the united states is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. and so i am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that america can sell things to all these people around the world. there are good trade deals and there are bad ones. so for example, here in florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with colombia. it's allowed flower exporters to come into the united states but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. we have a surplus with colombia. on the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. bottom line is i believe that america, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. if it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century.",1

"...are actually going to work. and just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what senator sanders put out -- remember, he had a plan for about, i don't know, 18, 20 years. he changed in the middle of this campaign. he put out another plan. people have been analyzing the new plan. and there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals. in fact, the washington post called it a train-wreck for the poor. a working woman on medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300. the same for free college. the free college offer -- you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print. you read the fine print, and here's what it says.",0
"well, i'm just not sure i agree completely with that assessment. i think under president obama we have seen a lot of advances, the affordable care act has helped more african americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did. we have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone. so, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society. i think president obama has set a great example. i think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward. now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next. we now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system. we now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. i think what president obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first african american president, and to address it both from the president's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and mrs. obama's work with young women. but, we can't rest. we have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before. so, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open. nobody can deny them. to use the justice department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out. so, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and",0
"and on the issue of job creation, i find this interesting. the private sector creates jobs. the jobs of those of us in public service are to put in place policies that allow the economy to grow. that's the problem with the democratic party. they think government is what creates jobs. government does not create jobs. now, the way you create jobs is you make america the easiest and the best place in the world to start a business or to expand an existing business. if you go on my website, marcorubio.com, you will see a real plan to fix our taxes, to roll back regulations, to repeal and replace obamacare, not just lines around the states. serious policies and proposals.",1
"yes, thank you. yes, lester, what secretary clinton just said is actually not true. what -- i have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of wall street. i have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic. look, if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist, he's just going to keep robbing banks again. the same thing is true with people in suits. secretary clinton, i have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say there's no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true. i support reinstituting a modern version of glass- steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things. in prior debates i've heard you even bring up -- i mean, now you bring up president obama here in south carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with wall street. in an earlier debate, i heard you bring up even the 9/11 victims to defend it. the truth of the matter is, secretary clinton, you do not go as far as reining in wall street as i would. and the fact of the matter is, the people of america deserve to have a president that's on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on wall street. and we're just as vulnerable today.",0
"i completely agree with chris. and this administration has been so lax. think about it. hillary clinton is using a private server for -- where classified information go by. this is a -- this is a serious administration? the president receives an inspector general's report that the office of personnel management could be hacked into; they had antiquated firewalls; 23 million files have been -- are in the hands of the chinese allegedly, including, by the way, members of the press, it turns out, last week. maybe that's the only part that's good news, so that you guys can get a feel for what it's like now to see this type of attack. this is something -- we have to have the best defensive capabilities. we need to coordinate all of our efforts with the private sector. we need to give them liability relief so that we can do that. and offensively, we need to have capabilities second to none. we need to create a situation where they know that there will be adverse impacts if they continue to do what they're doing. they'll respect that. they'll respect a united states that is serious about protecting our -- our infrastructure. if we don't do it, we'll continue to see what's -- exactly what's happening, not just from the chinese, by the way. the russians and rogue actors, including isis -- this is a serious part of the 21st century security challenge that we face.",1

"well, bret, as someone who spent much of his life in law enforcement, i believe you should start with the facts and evidence first before ending up with the verdict. when the news first broke of the united states government engaging in massive surveillance on american citizens, that was a very troubling development, and it's why the united states congress acted to correct it. now, at the same time, i said in that initial statement that if the evidence indicated that edward snowden violated the law, he should be prosecuted for violating the law. and, indeed, since then, the evidence is clear that not only does snowden violate the law, but it appears he committed treason. treason is defined under the constitution as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of america, and what snowden did made it easier for terrorists to avoid detection. and snowden's comments afterwards, and his behavior afterwards, he fled to russia, he fled to china. his conducts afterwards indicates that he was not a whistleblower, but instead he was undermining the ability to defend this country. but we need a president who isn't rash, who doesn't just pop off at the -- at the hip, but waits to see what the facts are and then acts to defend this country.",1
"well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in new york come from out of state. they come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in new york. but let me say this -- in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, senator sanders did run for the congress and he lost. he came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the nra that he would be against waiting periods. and, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here's what he said. he clearly was helped by the nra, because they ran ads against his opponent. so, then he went to the congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the nra. voting -- he kept his word to the nra, he voted against the brady bill five times because it had waiting periods in it. thankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them.",0

"well, maria, you are right. it is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of cuban immigrants. it really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides. you know, i would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you're liberal. that makes sense in the media, but i gotta tell you, one of the things i was most proud of when i ran for senate here in texas, i earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in texas. at the same time, mitt romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide. and, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community. the values in our community are faith, family, patriotism. you know, we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country. and, when i campaigned, and i campaigned the same here in houston or dallas as i did in the rio grande valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- christian principals, telling my father's story. telling my dad's story of coming to america with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking english, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the american dream. and, the truth is the obama-clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community. it is not working in the hispanic community, and",1

"look, let's start -- i've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes -- let's start with why russia is in syria right now. there are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. the first was the invasion of iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in iraq and empowered iran. the second was the arab spring, which created huge vacuums in libya and in syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. and the third was the recent deal allowing iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world. now, i say this as someone who spent five years in the pentagon and who opposed the war in iraq, whose son fought in iraq, i've fought in vietnam. but if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with china. and we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. we need to do it because of the way they treat their own people.",0

"okay, thank you. i have -- look, i would agree with much of what senator sanders says, kevin. i believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation. and, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, i actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition. i respectfully disagree with senator sander's approach. i believe that the goal should be debt-free college. i believe that our federal government needs to do more on pell grants. states need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government. 7 percent and 8 percent to go to college? i mean, my dad went to college on a g.i. bill after coming home from japan, flying 33 missions. my daughters went to college on a mountain of bills. we were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives. it -- it doesn't need to be that way. we can have debt-free college in the united states.",0

"let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right. that is what i want to do. that is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class. in the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth. and i know that term gets my republican friends nervous. the problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction. trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own. yes, i do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the cayman islands. yes, i do believe there must be a tax on wall street speculation. we bailed out wall street. it's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free. so we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.",0
"when we talk about immigration, the secretary will remember that one of the great tragedies, human tragedies of recent years is children came from honduras where there's probably more violence than almost any place in this country, and they came into this country. and i said welcome those children into this country, secretary clinton said send them back. that's a difference.",0
"i just want to say, i agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, i would absolutely get rid of obamacare. we're going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when i'm referring to that, and i was referring to that very strongly on the show with anderson cooper, i want to keep pre- existing conditions. i think we need it. i think it's a modern age. and i think we have to have it.",1
"sure. we would move the medicare system from a 7 percent growth down to about a 5 percent growth. and i have a whole series of ways to do that. in ohio, we reduced medicaid funding for the poor from 10 percent to 2.5 percent, didn't cut one benefit or didn't take anybody off the rolls. why? because we're innovators. i've been an innovator my entire career. and i really don't care what special interests or lobbyists have to say. i have a job to do when i take over a public office. now, we freeze non-defense discretionary for eight years. we also put an increase in defense spending. our tax cuts balance out. and at the end of the day, we will get to a balanced budget. and i want everybody here to know, when i was budget committee chairman in washington, i stepped on every toe in that town, and we got to a balanced budget, and we had enormous job growth. and as governor of ohio, we went from 350,000 lost jobs to a gain of 347,000 jobs.",1

"well look, i believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. the simple fact of the matter is i wouldn't be standing here. i'd be maybe running for president of croatia if we didn't have immigration. immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. but we clearly have to control our borders. we can't have people just walking in. look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. the country has to be able to lock its doors as well. so, we -- i have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration. i would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. and if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. no excuses because we can't continue this problem. i think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home. and i think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization. not to citizenship. i believe that program can pass the congress in the first 100 days. but let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of america is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget. we can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in america, all the people who are citizens of america, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that i used in washington. and guess what, i've used it in ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since i've been governor",1

"...that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, i believe strongly we have to guarantee health care. i believe we are on the path to doing that. the last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again. and we are not england. we are not france. we inherited a system that was set up during world war ii; 170 million americans get health insurance right now through their employers. so what we have tried to do and what president obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage. we have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100. i far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.",0

"well, i think the key word in your followup there was the word ""settle."" that's true. it was settled. arrests peaked in 2003, anderson, but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime. look, none of this is easy. none of us has all the answers. but together as a city, we saved a lot of lives. it was about leadership. it was about principle. and it was about bringing people together.",0

"well, i certainly know what all americans need, and that is more jobs, with rising incomes. it's something that i have worked on for many years. it's why i've laid down the only really comprehensive plan about how to create more good jobs. and there are several things that need to be addressed. we do have to do more infrastructure spending. that will put many americans to work. it's a good job that gets you on the ladder to the middle class. we need to improve the conditions for manufacturing in our country and punish those companies that want to export jobs. we need them to be incentivized to create jobs right here in america. we also do have to combat climate change, and no state has more at stake in that than florida. and the best way to do that is not only enforcing the laws we have, but also the clean power plan that president obama has put forth that i support, and the paris agreement that i think was a huge step forward in the world, that senator sanders said was too weak, but i helped to lay the groundwork for that. but we need more clean energy jobs and we have to do more to help small businesses. you know, the fastest-growing segment of small businesses are minority and women-owned small business, and we need to help businesses get started. the very distinguished congresswoman from new york who's been on the small business committee, congresswoman velasquez, knows exactly what we need to be doing to create more small businesses. we do need to raise the minimum wage and we have to guarantee equal pay for women.",0

"yes, let's talk about this. when i ran for mayor in 1999, lester, it was not because our city was doing well. it was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year. and that's why i ran, because, yes, black lives matter. and we did a number of things. we weren't able to make our city immune from setbacks as the freddie gray unrest and tragic death showed. but we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations. the truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board. and many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that i've put forward. we created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives. we required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force. i repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state. i drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows, and became the first governor south of the mason-dixon line to repeal the death penalty. i feel a responsibility every day to find things that work...",0

"well, first of all, healthcare is not a right. but i do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that. we spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do. i propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats. and we give it to everybody from birth until death. they can pass it on when they die. we pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. we give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. so dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle. and it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. it gives you enormous flexibility. and also, you know, if uncle joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody's going to hide his cigarettes because they're all interested in what's going on there. also, the -- your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare. so, it's like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered. one costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year. you can buy the $1,500 one. that will take care of 75 percent of the people. the people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now? medicaid. what's the medicaid budget? almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which i hope we get a chance to talk about. but do the math. over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all -- they will have a lot more flexibility. what could you buy with that? a concierge practice.",1

"judy, i think that the best analysis that i've seen based on senator sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example. last week in a cnn town hall, the senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare. every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math. this is about people's lives, and we should level with the american people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.",0

"well, i think you ask a very important question, because the issue here -- the next president of the united states has to fill this vacancy. justice scalia -- in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the constitution is not a living and breathing document -- it is supposed to be applied as originally meant. and the next president of the united states has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as scalia -- plus there may be at least two other vacancies. so you ask mr. trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would. but the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side. now, if he's changed, we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement. but the bottom line is that, if you don't have a record there to look at and say, ""i feel at peace that when donald trump is president of the united states, he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues."" in fact, very recently, he was still defending planned parenthood. he says he's not going to take sides in the palestinians versus israel. these are concerning things. and so, yes, i have a doubt about whether donald trump, if he becomes president, will replace justice scalia with someone just like justice scalia.",1
"and i appreciate greatly senator sanders' voting record. and i was very proud to get the endorsement of the planned parenthood action fund, because i've been a leader on these issues. i have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves. i'm very proud that naral endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues. somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights. so i'm asking women, i'm asking men, to support me because i'm ready to go into the white house on january 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.",0

but let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the american people. people aren't dumb. why in god's name does wall street make huge campaign contributions? i guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.,0
"so, when you ask me about my priorities, my priorities are that no, we're not going to give tax breaks to the wealthy. we're going to ask them to start paying their fair share of taxes so we can raise the money to make sure that every child in this country, in detroit, in vermont, gets the quality education that he or she deserves.",0
"because they don't cover most of the subjects. we're the policemen of the world. we take care of the entire world. we're going to have a stronger military, much stronger. our military is depleted. but we take care of germany, we take care of saudi arabia, we take care of japan, we take care of south korea. we take -- every time this maniac from north korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. we get virtually nothing. we have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between north and south korea. we have so many places. saudi arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them. we are going to be in a different world. we're going to negotiate real deals now, and we're going to bring the wealth back to our country. we owe $19 trillion. we're going to bring wealth back to our country.",1
"thank you. i began this journey six months ago. my total focus was on building up our military, building up our strength, building up our borders, making sure that china, japan, mexico, both at the border and in trade, no longer takes advantage of our country. certainly would never have made that horrible, disgusting, absolutely incompetent deal with iran where they get $150 billion. they're a terrorist nation. but i began it talking about other things. and those things are things that i'm very good at and maybe that's why i'm center stage. people saw it. people liked it. people respected it. a month ago things changed. radical islamic terrorism came into effect even more so than it has been in the past. people like what i say. people respect what i say. and we've opened up a very big discussion that needed to be opened up. thank you very much.",1
"well, i would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name. i would ask them to listen to what i'm proposing, look at what i've accomplished in the senate, as secretary of of state, and then draw your own conclusion. i certainly am not campaigning to become president because my last name is clinton. i'm campaigning because i think i have the right combination of what the country needs, at this point, and i think i can take the fight to the republicans, because we cannot afford a republican to succeed barack obama as president of the united states.",0
"we should -- we should learn -- we should learn from king abdullah of jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place. and what abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of islam and that muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries. that is how we destroy isis, not with american troops in perpetual warfare.",0
"well, i think we should have policies that don't allow them to just enlarge themselves at the expense of smaller entities. and certainly some of the policies, some of the monetary and fed policies that we're using makes it very easy for them, makes it very easy for the big corporations, quite frankly, at these very low interest rates to buy back their stock and to drive the price of that up artificially. those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place. and i think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation. this country was -- declared its independence in 1776. in less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. and the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. those are the fuels that drive it. and what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. if we can get that out, it makes a big difference. and even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. and it's shifted to the individual. so -- and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich. they go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it. and the middle class, when they come to the cash register, have a whole cart full of things that cost 5, 10 or 15 cents more, they notice it. it is hurting the poor. bernie sanders and hillary clinton won't tell you that that's the thing that's really hurting middle class in the core. they'll say it's the rich, take their money, but that won't help. you can take all of the rich's money and it won't make a dent in the problem that we're having. we have to come back to the fundamental principles that made america great.",1
"yes. anderson, i want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from vermont mentioned, and i actually did them in our state. we raised the minimum wage, passed the living wage, invested more in infrastructure, went four years in a row without a penny's increase in college tuition. but there's another piece that senator sanders left out tonight, but he's been excellent about underscoring that. and that is that we need to separate the casino, speculative, mega-bank gambling that we have to insure with our money, from the commercial banking -- namely, reinstating glass-steagall. secretary clinton mentioned my support eight years ago. and secretary, i was proud to support you eight years ago, but something happened in between, and that is, anderson, a wall street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families. and we are still just as vulnerable paul volcker says today. we need to reinstate glass-steagall and that's a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates.",0
"i think this goes back to essentially what we've been saying for the last two or three questions. carly fiorina also said we're not going to talk with putin. well, think if reagan had said that during the cold war? we continued to talk with the russians throughout the cold war which is much more significant that where we are now. should we continue to talk with iran? yes. should we cut up the agreement immediately? that's absurd. wouldn't you want to know if they complied? now, i'm going to vote against the agreement because i don't think there's significant leverage, but it doesn't mean that i would immediately not look at the agreement, and cut it up without looking to see if whether or not iran has complied. the same goes with china. i don't think we need to be rash, i don't think we need to be reckless, and i think need to leave lines of communication open. often we talk about whether we should be engaged in the world, or disengaged in the world, and i think this is an example of some who want to isolate us, actually, and not be engaged. we do need to be engaged with russia. it doesn't mean we give them a free pass, or china a free pass, but, to be engaged, to continue to talk. we did throughout the cold war, and it would be a big mistake not to do it here.",1
"well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it. that's kind of a no-brainer. you know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, i think it's a good idea to call 911. do it.",0
"i agree with what the secretary said. we shouldn't be getting ahead of ourselves. and as i have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand. i happen to respect the secretary very much, i hope it's mutual. and on our worst days, i think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any republican candidate.",0
"a group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about senator sanders's views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting iranian troops into syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of israel. asking saudi arabia and iran to work together, when they can't stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment. so i do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when new hampshire voters go on tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief. and there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that white house from day to day that can pose a threat to the united states or one of our friends and allies, and i think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.",0
"and in order to be correct on this issue, here's the bottom line. we do work. there is -- islam has a major problem on its hands. it has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the sunni faith but also in the shia, who have been radicalized. and are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people. there is no doubt about that. it is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other -- with muslims, who do not -- who are not radicals. we're going to have to work with the jordanian kingdom. we're going to have to work with the saudis. we're going to have to work with the gulf kingdoms. we're going to have to work with the egyptians to defeat, for example, isis.",1
"i am the very first post-9/11 mayor and the very first post-9/11 governor. i understand, from the ground up, that when attacks like san bernardino happen, when attacks like the attacks of 9/11 happen, that when people call 911, the first people to show up are the local first responders. many of the things secretary clinton said are absolutely true, but they underscore a lack of investment that we have, as a nation, failed to make over these last 15 years in intelligence gathering, intelligence analysis, intelligence sharing. not only in theater, in syria and iraq and other places where we embalk [sic] ourselves in toppling dictators without having any idea what comes next, but here in the homeland, as we protect people from this threat of the lone wolves and these changing tactics and strategies. i believe that what's happened here is that the president had us on the right course, but it's a lack of battle tempo. we have to increase the battle tempo, we have to bring a modern way of getting things done and forcing the sharing of information and do a much better job of acting on it in order to prevent these sorts of attacks in the future.",0
"because the country will become a dynamic economy. we'll be dynamic again. if you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world. we pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax. we have the highest taxes in the world. it's shutting off our economy. it's shutting off our country. we have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in. yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great. we will have a dynamic economy again.",1
"no. and i -- and i think you've outlined why. the numbers don't add up. you know, when i ran for the senate in 2010, i came out and said we're going to have to make changes to social security, and everyone said that's the end of your campaign. in florida, you can't talk about that, but people know that it's the truth here in florida. fraud is not enough. certainly, let's wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won't add up. you already gave those numbers. the second point is on foreign aid. i hear that all the time as well. i'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget. the numbers don't add up. the bottom line is we can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like i'm going to get at fraud and abuse. let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. but you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up. and here's the thing. if we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis. not to mention a crisis in social security and medicare. both parties have taken far too long to deal with it. it is one of the major issues confronting america. it's barely been asked in any of these debates. and we'd better deal with or we're going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster.",1
"martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why i have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from isis. and of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the russians, who are also flying in that space. i'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the security council, which embodies actually an agreement that i negotiated back in geneva in june of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in syria to begin to try to make a transition. a no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.",0
"second point -- second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country -- largely african-american and latino -- the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process. no, you just can't negotiate with mitch mcconnell. mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, ""mitch, stop representing the billionaire class. start listening to working families."" and as president, that's what i will work hard on.",0

"no, i'm a big defender of the second amendment. and if you look at what's happened, whether it's in california, where you had the 14 people killed, whether it's in paris -- which, by the way, has the toughest gun laws in the world and 130 people killed. many, many people in the hospital gravely injured. they will be dying. many people will be dying in addition. if we had guns, or if they had guns on the other side of the room, with the bullets going in the opposite direction, you would not have had 130 people killed. that i can tell you right now.",1
"well, first of all, we got a lot of business done with the russians when medvedev was the president, and not putin. we got a nuclear arms deal, we got the iranian sanctions, we got an ability to bring important material and equipment to our soldiers in afghanistan. there's no doubt that when putin came back in and said he was going to be president, that did change the relationship. we have to stand up to his bullying, and specifically in syria, it is important -- and i applaud the administration because they are engaged in talks right now with the russians to make it clear that they've got to be part of the solution to try to end that bloody conflict. and, to -- provide safe zones so that people are not going to have to be flooding out of syria at the rate they are. and, i think it's important too that the united states make it very clear to putin that it's not acceptable for him to be in syria creating more chaos, bombing people on behalf of assad, and we can't do that if we don't take more of a leadership position, which is what i'm advocating.",0

"well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the american economy. right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers. what that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working americans. our system isn't working. and then on top of that, we've got a system that's allowing in millions of people to be here illegally. and the answer to that, i've laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. we're going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. we're going to end sanctuary cities. and let me tell you how we're going to do that. we're going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws.",1
"and that's exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the affordable care act -- what governor o'malley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down, we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system. but, with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that i think would set us back. the republicans just voted last week to repeal the affordable care act, and thank goodness, president obama vetoed it and saved obamacare for the american people.",0

"it's not going to happen tomorrow. and it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies. but at the end of the day, nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right? why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want? why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people? it will not happen tomorrow. but when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and i will lead that effort. medicare for all, single-payer system is the way we should go.",0
"a couple of years ago, i had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation. and i went to one of these turkish refugee camps right on the border of syria. and what a sad sight that was: men, women, children forced out of their homes. and turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people. it seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that i very strongly disagree with those republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all. that is not what america is supposed to be about. so i believe that working with europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world. you got kuwait and you got qatar and you got saudi arabia. they have a responsibility, as well. but i think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from syria and afghanistan, as well.",0

"we're going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. and the thing to understand, stephen, we can solve these problems. it's not that we don't know how to do it. it's that we're lacking the political will. neither of the parties in washington wants to do this. the democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the republicans are doing the bidding of wall street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor. we need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country. we need an immigration system that takes care of the jobs of the working men and women of this country.",1
"well, this is what i would say. it is a complicated relationship. i congratulate secretary of state john kerry and the president for working on this agreement. as you've indicated, what is happening in syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable. it is a real horror. now, what i think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with russia. but let's be clear: russia's aggressive actions in the crimea and in ukraine have brought about a situation where president obama and nato -- correctly, i believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action. i happen to believe that putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him. but bottom line is: the president is right. we have to put more money. we have to work with nato to protect eastern europe against any kind of russian aggression.",0

"sure, because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating, or you're going to be bankrupt again. and, the problem with puerto rico is it's economy is not growing. it has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of florida, and all over the country. they're coming to the mainland from puerto rico because the economy there is not growing, it's too expensive to do business there. the tax rate is too high. the government regulations are too extensive. this year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next. so, i think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again. if the economy of puerto rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments. so, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland. they're united states citizens, they're obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a puerto rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust. and, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job. their previous governor, louis fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election",1

"let me go answer mr. mcghee's question because i think it's a profound one. i think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when i was a teenager, insisting that we go in to inner-city chicago because i lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches. it was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear dr. king speak in chicago when i was about 14 years old. that got me thinking about what i needed to do to try to fulfill my faith. when i was in law school, i had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named mary right adelman, who worked with dr. king who was the first african-american woman who passed the mississippi bar. i asked her for a job and she said she didn't have any money. i was working my way through law school and she said if i could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. so i got law students a civil rights research council grant. the first thing she did was send me to look at south carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. the second thing she did was to send me to alabama to investigate segregated academies. so from that moment until today, i am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the children's defense fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything i can to address systemic racism.",0

"wolf, you sit up here and you listen to this stuff, and you think that so many of these people have had so much to do in this national debate, they talk like they were bystanders. you know, we talk about our military being degraded over time, and yet we've had folks on this stage who've been a part of congress who have participated in sequester; who participated in the degrading of this military over time. and that's why i think people get so frustrated with washington, d.c. now. that's why they're so angry with the -- the electorate is so angry with everybody who is involved in government in washington, d.c. because if you listen to the folks up here, you think that they weren't even there; they had nothing to do with this. this is a difference between being a governor and being in a legislature. see, because when something doesn't work in new jersey, they look at me, say: ""why didn't it get done? why didn't you do it?"" you have to be responsible and accountable. and so on isis, let's be clear, the president needs to be a force that is trusted in the world. on this i agree with marco. you know, this president is not trusted. if you're the king of jordan, if you're a part of the royal family in saudi arabia and he's made this deal with iran which gives them $150 billion to wage a war and try to extend their empire across the middle east, why would you want to do it now? but i will tell you this, when i stand across from king hussein of jordan and i say to him, ""you have a friend again sir, who will stand with you to fight this fight,"" he'll change his mind.",1
"well, i turned 13 years old two days before ronald reagan was first elected. a lot of people forget this, but just a few days before that election 1980, he was behind in the polls. and i think what changed things was people in america realized they didn't want to hear what was bad about america, they wanted to know how it was going to be better. ronald reagan wasn't just a conservative republican, he was an eternal optimist in the american people. and i am too. so here's what i think will make america better. we need to live in a world where our children are free, are free from the threats of radical islamic terrorism. we need to live in an america where we have an economy, where everyone can live their piece of the american dream, no matter what that dream is. and we need to live in an america where we have a federal government that is not too big to fail, but ultimately small enough to succeed, where we send powers back to the states and back to the people. that's what i did in wisconsin. we took on the big government union bosses, the big government special interests, many of whom came in from washington, to spend millions of dollars to try and take me out because we stood up to them, we didn't back down in any of those instances. if you give me the chance as your next president, i won't back down any day, anyway, anyhow. i'll fight and win for you and your families every single day i'm in office.",1

"well, i'm not going to comment on the benghazi tragedy, but i will say this. a series of articles in the new york times talked about secretary clinton's role in urging the administration to go forward with regime change, getting rid of gadhafi in libya. gadhafi was a brutal dictator, there's no question. but one of the differences between the secretary and i is i'm not quite so aggressive with regard to regime change. i voted against the war in iraq because i had a fear of what would happen the day after.",0

"but in all of that senator and secretary, i think we're leaving out something very important here. and that is that we still don't have the human intelligence: overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things. we are walking through this region, andrea, without the human intelligence that we need. and we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers, and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places. so we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.",0
"but in terms of education, this is what i think. this is the year 2015. a college degree today, dana, is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago. and what we said 50 years ago and a hundred years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family. i think we have to say that is true for everybody going to college. i think we don't need a complicated system, which the secretary is talking about, the income goes down, the income goes down, if you're poor you have to work, and so forth and so on. i pay for my program, by the way, through a tax on wall street speculation, which will not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt, a major crisis in this country.",0
"no. it's not true. but i have said that mr. trump's language is divisive. i want to win. i want one of these people here or the ones at 5:00, to be the next president of the united states. we're not going on win by doing what barack obama and hillary clinton do each and every day. dividing the country. saying, creating a grievance kind of environment. we're going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message. i have that message because i was a governor of a state that saw people lifted up, because we had high sustained economic growth. our economy grew at double the rate of the nation. we created 1.3 million jobs. we led the nation seven out of those eight years. we were only one of two states that went to aaa bond rating. i cut taxes, $19 billion. if you do that and apply conservative principles the right way, you create an environment where everybody rises up. that's how we're going to win. campaigning in places to give people hope that their life is better because too many people are suffering today in america.",1

"well, maria, it's great to be with you. it's great to be here in milwaukee. you know, the question you asked really i think is the most important question any of us can have -- face, which is, how do we get the economy growing? how do we bring back economic growth? because economic growth, it's foundational to every other challenge we have. as you rightly noted, from 2008 to today, our economy has grown 1.2 percent a year on average. the obama economy is a disaster, and the imf is telling us this is a new normal. it doesn't have to be. if you look at the history of america, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth. the first is tax reform. and as you noted, i have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every american that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade. the second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses. and the third element is sound money. every time we've pursued all three of those -- whether in the 1920s with calvin coolidge or the 1960s with jfk or the 1980s with ronald reagan -- the result has been incredible economic growth. we have done it before, and with leadership, we can do it again.",1

"i think -- i think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement. we both believe there has to be more money going into the social security system. i've said i'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the social security trust fund. i have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. first, rather than expand benefits for everyone, i do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. i want to take care of women. when the social security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. and women have been disadvantaged ever since. they do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. and the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their social security monthly payment. so we have no disagreement about the need to buttress social security, get more revenue into the program. but i want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.",0

"well, let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they're related. as i've said many times before, my parents were never rich people. my father was a bartender. my mother was a maid. they worked for a living. but they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves. we call that the american dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. it is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people. what makes america special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful. the problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. if i thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, i would be all for it, but it isn't. in the 20th century, it's a disaster. if you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine. and that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated. here's the best way to raise wages. make america the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. for the life of me, i don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education. welders make more money than philosophers. we need more welders and less philosophers.",1

"i think one of the great problems, and what american people don't like about politics, is hypocrisy. people have one standard for others and not for them -- for themselves. there is at least one prominent example on the stage of someone who says they smoked pot in high school, and yet the people going to -- to jail for this are poor people, often african-americans and often hispanics, and yet the rich kids who use drugs aren't. i personally think that this is a crime for which the only victim is the individual, and i think that america has to take a different attitude. i would like to see more rehabilitation and less incarceration. i'm a fan of the drug courts which try to direct you back towards work and less time in jail. but the bottom line is the states. we say we like the 10th amendment, until we start talking about this. and i think the federal government has gone too far, i think that the war on drugs has had a racial outcome, and really has been something that has really damaged our inner cities. not only do the drugs damage them, we damage them again by incarcerating them and then preventing them from getting employment over time. so i don't think that the federal government should override the states. i believe in the 10th amendment and i really will say that the states are left to themselves.",1

"i am advocating the no-fly zone both because i think it would help us on the ground to protect syrians; i'm also advocating it because i think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with russia. now that russia has joined us in the security council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in geneva three years ago, now i think we can have those conversations. the no-fly zone, i would hope, would be also shared by russia. if they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of assad toward isis and put the assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.",0

"well, let me say that legal immigration is not an issue i read about in the newspaper. immigration, illegal immigration, all the good aspects of immigration and all the negative ones as well, i live with. my family's immigrants. my neighbors are all immigrants. my in-laws are all immigrants. so i've seen every aspect of it, and i can tell you america doesn't have one immigration problem, it has three. first, despite the fact that we are the most generous country in the history of the world in allowing people to come here legally, we have people still coming illegally. second, we have a legal immigration system that no longer works. it primary is built on the basis of whether you have a relative living here instead of merit. and third, we have 11 million or 12 million people, many of whom have been here for longer than a decade who are already here illegally. and we must deal with all three of these problems. we cannot deal with all three of these problems in one massive piece of legislation. i learned that. we tried it that way. here's the way forward: first, we must -- we must secure our border, the physical border, with -- with a wall, absolutely. but we also need to have an entry/exit tracking system. 40 percent of the people who come here illegally come legally, and then they overstay the visa. we also need a mandatory e-verify system. after we've done that, step two would be to modernize our legal immigration system so you come to america on the basis of what you can contribute economically, not whether or not simply you have a relative living here. and after we've done those two things, i believe the american people...",1
"i got that. and the problem today is there's no confidence in washington, d.c. there needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies. they understand that there's a national security risk. we ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit. we need to make sure that we keep the country safe. this is the first priority. the cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely. not just the hacking of opm, but that is -- that is just shameful. 23 million files in the hands of the chinese? so it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game. we should put the nsa in charge of the civilian side of this as well. that expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.",1
"so was i, john. let me get a chance to respond. this issue touches on two broad issues. it's not just wall street. it's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system. and it is easy to talk the talk about ending citizens united, but what i think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and wall street for campaign contributions, and that's what i'm doing. in terms of wall street, i respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth. when you have wall street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish glass-stegall.",0

"well, i'm glad you asked that, maria. here's -- here's our plan. we've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform. if you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know. and what that's led to over $2 trillion of american companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. and who can blame them? they pay tax once overseas. they don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back. so beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money. bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the united states. we'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. and i would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country. it would not necessitate us raising any taxes. it would bring the money back into the united states to help build jobs by american companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. and -- and -- and the last piece of this, maria, is this. you know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in america. he's penalized -- and doesn't understand. in fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers. you've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the obama administration. that's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. we'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively. and remember this -- i'm credible on this for this reason: americans for tax reform says that i've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in american history. we don't need to raise taxes to get this done. we need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the united states to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists. all of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a christie administration.",1

"my name is martin o'malley, former mayor of baltimore, former governor of maryland, a life long democrat, and most importantly, a husband, and a father. my wife katie and i have four great kids, grace, and tara, and william and jack. and, like you, there is nothing we wouldn't do to give them healthier and better lives. there are some things that i have learned to do better in life than others. and, after 15 years of executive experience, i have learned how to be an effective leader. whether it was raising the minimum wage, making our public schools the best in america, passing marriage equality, the dream act, and comprehensive gun safety legislation, i have learned how to get things done because i am very clear about my principals. thanks to president obama, our country has come a long way since the wall street crash of 2008. our country's doing better, we are creating jobs again. but we elected a president, not a magician, and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now. for there is a -- deep injustice, an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart, and it will not solve itself. injustice does not solve itself. what i'm talking about is this, our middle class is shrinking. our poor families are becoming poorer, and 70 percent of us are earning the same, or less than we were 12 years ago. we need new leadership, and we need action. the sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all american families. our economy isn't money, it's people. it's all of our people, and so we must invest in our country, and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families, instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt. and, we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity. the future is what we make of it. we are all in this together. and, the question in this election is whether you and i still have the ability to give our kids a better future. i believe we do, that is why i am running for president, and i need your help. thank you.",0
"you know, i completely agree with senator sanders. the first speech i gave in this campaign back in april was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration. the statistics from wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for african-americans in our nation, twice the national average. and we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of dontre hamilton right here in milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us. his family certainly believes that. and so do i. so we have work to do. there have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. president obama's policing commission came out with some. i have fully endorsed those. but we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect. and, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level. but, i would also add this. there are other racial discrepancies. really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities. so, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.",0

"as far as being an outsider is concerned -- as far as being an outsider is concerned, let me tell you this, jake, i'm a republican in new jersey. i wake up every morning as an outsider. i wake up every morning with a democratic legislature who trying to beat my head in and fight me because i'm trying to bring conservative change to a state that needed it desperately. and so, everyone can talk us here about their credentials. but the bottom line is, every morning i get up, i veto 400 bills from a crazy liberal democratic legislature, not one of them has been overridden. i've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in american history, according to americans for tax reform. what folks want in this country is somebody to go down there and get the job done. and that's exactly what i'll do. so, i know this much, that what the american people want to hire right now is somebody who believes in them. and believes that they are the ones who can fix our country. i will be the vessel through which they can fix this country, but it's not about me. it's about all of you. and getting this government off your back and out of your way, and letting you succeed. i know ben wasn't talking about me.",1
"the greatest threat to our national security is our debt. we borrow a million dollars a minute. and whose fault is it? well, frankly, it's both parties' fault. you have those on the right who clamor and say, oh, we will spend anything on the military, and those on the left who say the same for domestic welfare. but what most americans don't realize is there is an unholy alliance. they come together. there's a secret handshake. we spend more money on everything. and we are not stronger nation if we go further into debt. we are not projecting power from bankruptcy court. to me, there is no greater threat than our debt. i'm the only fiscal conservative on the stage because i'm willing to hold the line on all spending. i hope you will consider me in the election. thank you very much.",1
"no, it is not breaking my word. when you are -- it's one thing to say i'm raising taxes, it's another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums. so, if i save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.",0
"i have no argument with having a strong leader, and to be aggressive where aggression is needed. but it is not needed in every circumstance. there is a time when you can use your intellect to come up with other ways to do things. and i think that's what we have to start thinking about. there is no question that a lot of these problems that we have been talking about in terms of the international situation is because we are weak. it is because our navy is so small. it is because our air force is incapable of doing the same things that it did a few years ago. it's because our marines corps is not ready to be deployed.",1
"the individual mandate. he said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which i don't believe that should be part of it. that should not remain there. i think here's what we need to replace it with. we need to repeal obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts americans in charge of their health care money again. if your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in america they want to buy it from. otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country. and if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. and that, i think, is a much better approach than obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy. it is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time. it is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. and i will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all americans.",1

"well, jake, i grew up in a blue collar family. and the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade. one out of five americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million americans are connected to it. but my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. and i've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, ""oh, america was right,"" and people are out of work. the fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. when people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. and as president of the united states, i absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the american worker. but we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. people will buy less. other people will be out of work. and we don't want to see that happen. trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, i will stand up and i will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the american worker expects us to stand up. and jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar. i understand their plight.",1

"well, i -- if i might. i think the issue here is -- and i applaud secretary clinton. she did. she's the senator from new york. she worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation. but at the end of the day, wall street today has enormous economic and political power. their business model is greed and fraud. and for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.",0
"and, you know, i do think it's important to do exactly what senator sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the american people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about. and to contrast, even -- there are differences among us. you've heard some of those tonight. i still want to get back to health care, because i think that's a worthy topic to explore. but the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the republican side. and if you listen to what they say -- and i had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what i see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans. i mean, all of us support funding planned parenthood. all of us believe climate change is real. all of us want equal pay for equal work. they don't believe in any of that. so let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.",0
"well, dana, the heritage foundation had this position as well. and when i look at it, i don't think it's tenable. and we don't need to do that. again, i'm telling you that we are going to -- we have a proposal, a plan that we're enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you're providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint -- some charge high, some charge low. if you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess. that is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare. because if you think about your own deductibles today, they're going higher, higher and higher. and you know what? at some point, people can't afford it. our plan will work. it uses the market. it uses transparency. it gets the patient in the middle. and guess what? we're actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country. and if this will go -- this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on. we will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in america and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition. we don't want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, dana. so that's really what we're doing. this is not a theory. this is what we are actually doing in our state. we will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives. if our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what? they will get a financial reward. our primary care physicians need help. they need support. we're losing them. this will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.",1
"yes look, i have made it clear based on senator sanders' own record that he has voted with the nra, with the gun lobby numerous times. he voted against the brady bill five times. he voted for what we call, the charleston loophole. he voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the nra said, ""was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. "" he voted to let guns go onto the amtrak, guns go into national parks. he voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives. let's not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country. that's 33,000 people a year. one of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered. now, i am pleased to hear that senator sanders has reversed his position on immunity and i look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation. there is no other industry in america that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.",0

"well, i wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it. i mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home. the government has lied to you and they have stolen from you. they told you that your social security money is in a trust fund. all that's in that trust fund is a pile of ious for money they spent on something else a long time ago. and they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and social security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years. we're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service. and, that's with zero percent interest rates. now, i'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements. and we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. and, here's the difference between me and hillary clinton. what hillary clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise social security taxes. now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there. if somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more? or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, i'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend. we need to get realistic about this. we're not -- the american people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from. and...",1

"and senator paul knows that that's simply not the truth. in new jersey, we have medical marijuana laws, which i supported and implemented. this is not medical marijuana. there's goes as much -- a further step beyond. this is recreational use of marijuana. this is much different. and so, while he would like to use a sympathetic story to back up his point, it doesn't work. i'm not against medical marijuana. we do it in new jersey. but i'm against the recreational use against marijuana. if he wants to change the federal law, get congress to pass the law to change it, and get a president to sign it.",1
"well, look, first of all, i think the mayor now is controlling the schools. this is not much different than what happened in cleveland, ohio, where the african-american democrat mayor, the union, and business leaders came to see me and said, ""would you help us to pass legislation to really create a ceo environment so that we can take control of the schools?"" we even invested in a buyout plan, where we bought out the teachers who had been there a long time, because there were so many young teachers who had been laid off who were so enthusiastic to get back in the schools. it worked beautifully. cleveland's coming back. the cleveland schools are coming back because of a major overhaul. it's the same thing that has to happen in all of our urban schools. and, frankly, look, if i were president, i'd take 104 federal programs, bundle them into four buckets, and send it to the states, because fixing schools rests at the state and the local level, and particularly at the school board level.",1

"i would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in washington, d.c. we need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind. the simple fact is one of the ways, maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country. we need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --",1
"well, donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade. he's right about the problems. but his solutions don't work. so, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods. now he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight. i don't know where he'll be tonight. but i'll tell you what happens. you know, we've seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, smoot- hawley led to the great depression. and the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent. but not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the american people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs. a much better solution that works is the tax plan i've laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs. fix the problem and that's what's missing from what donald says.",1

"well, what's happening right now, neil, is something that not been a subject of conversation by politicians. as primarily the only politician, i guess other than carly on the stage, they haven't talked about a corporate inversion. a corporate inversion -- companies are leaving. you know, we used to leave new york to go to florida. we got better taxes, we got, maybe, something else. now, they're the united states to go to other countries. they have trillions of dollars in those other countries. they're going for two reasons, they can't get their money back in. it's something where the democrats and the republicans both agree, it's the only thing i can think of. they both agree, let the money come back in. three and a half years, they still can't make a deal. they can't get the money in. it's probably two and a half trillion, but, i think it's much more than that. all of that money could become -- could come right in and be used to rebuild our country, and investments in our country. they can't do it. what we have to do, and what i've done, is made the tax rate -- and one of the reasons they don't (inaudible) the taxes so obnoxious, they can't do it. where, i made it a 10% number, as you know. i've been very highly praised for it. a lot of money's going to come back in, we're going to get rid of the bureaucratic problems, and roadblocks, because that's also a problem. and, we're going to have all of this money pour back into the united states. it's going to be used to build businesses, for jobs, and everything else. and, as i say, my expression is, let's make america great again.",1

"look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession. we actually passed a living wage. we raised the minimum wage. we actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market american capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state. all through the recession, we defended the highest median income in america and the second highest median income for african american families. how? by actually doing more for education. we increased education funding by 37 percent. we were the only state in american that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition. we invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future. we created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.",0

"i'm gonna fight as hard as i can to make sure that we shift power away from washington, simplify the tax code, to spur economic activity in this country. of course it's the highest priority. if we don't do that, we're stuck with the ""new normal"" of 2 percent growth. hillary clinton says, basically, we just gotta get used to it. two percent growth means declining income for the middle class. it means more than 6 million people are stuck in poverty than the day that barack obama was inaugurated. it means -- it means more demands on government -- growing the economy is the first job, if we're going to be serious about dealing with the deficit and debt. and more importantly, people are really struggling right now. in this economy, the disposable income of the great middle is down 2,300 bucks. so yeah, we've created jobs, your -- argue -- brought that up early, and it was a good question. jobs are being created, but they're lower-income jobs than the jobs that were lost. and the net effect of this is we need to jump-start the economy. i think of jonathan and reagan love , who are supporters of mine. jonathan has been deployed by the national guard, he is -- he's in oklahoma. reagan love -- by the way, pretty great name, i think -- is a teacher. when -- if they had this tax cut, what they told me was that that $2,300 of money in their pocket -- they would go back to south carolina and start a business. imagine what it would be like, instead of having more businesses closed than started, we had it the exact opposite. we would grow our economy, and the government would get the revenue necessary to make things -- make things better. hillary clinton's approach to this is more top-down, more regulation, more taxes, more government, and it will destroy our economy.",1
"wolf, i believe in a america first foreign policy, that far too often president obama and hillary clinton -- and, unfortunately, more than a few republicans -- have gotten distracted from the central focus of keeping this country safe. so let's go back to the beginning of the obama administration, when hillary clinton and barack obama led nato in toppling the government in libya. they did it because they wanted to promote democracy. a number of republicans supported them. the result of that -- and we were told then that there were these moderate rebels that would take over. well, the result is, libya is now a terrorist war zone run by jihadists. move over to egypt. once again, the obama administration, encouraged by republicans, toppled mubarak who had been a reliable ally of the united states, of israel, and in its place, morsi and the muslim brotherhood came in, a terrorist organization. and we need to learn from history. these same leaders -- obama, clinton, and far too many republicans -- want to topple assad. assad is a bad man. gadhafi was a bad man. mubarak had a terrible human rights record. but they were assisting us -- at least gadhafi and mubarak -- in fighting radical islamic terrorists. and if we topple assad, the result will be isis will take over syria, and it will worsen u.s. national security interests. and the approach, instead of being a woodrow wilson democracy promoter...",1

"they don't want to raise the minimum wage; they don't want to do anything to increase incomes. at the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up. of course we have to raise the minimum wage. of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with market basket right here in new hampshire and new england, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.",0
"well, with respect to syria, i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made. the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria. the agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to. you know, the russians wanted to buy time. are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. but i would add this. you know, the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution. at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together. this is incredibly complicated, because we've got iran as a big player, in addition to russia. we have saudi arabia, turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. this is one of the areas i've disagreed with senator sanders on, who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria, which i think would be a grave mistake. putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me. trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. so let's support what secretary kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. and remember, the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups. so as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and the like. so we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the russians.",0
"you know, the nasdaq dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the nasdaq to recover. i was recruited to h.p. to save a company. it was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders. it had missed, before i had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row. as an outsider, i tackled h.p.'s entrenched problems head-on. i cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment. and yes, it was a very difficult time. however, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like gateway -- taking all their jobs with them. the truth is i had to make some tough calls in some tough times. i think, actually, people are looking for that in washington now. and yes, i was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom. there are politics in the boardroom as well. and yet the man who led my firing, tom perkins, an icon of silicon valley, has come out publicly and said, ""you know what? we were wrong. she was right. she was a great ceo. she'd be a great president of the united states because the leadership she brought to h.p. is exactly the leadership we need in washington, d.c.",1

"but on this point, if i may add something on this point. we are all frustrated with what china is doing. i think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why. china doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. if you send a tie or a shirt made in china into the united states and an american goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer. so i think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against china economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage barack obama is doing to this economy. it begins with tax reform. let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. let's allow companies to immediately expense.",1

"let me agree with governor o'malley and let me agree with secretary clinton. you know, we had this incident before, secretary, with your famous e-mails. right? and what i said and i think what governor o'malley is saying, and i hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues. media notwithstanding. those are the issues that the american people want discussed. i hope those are the issues we'll discuss.",0
"the american people -- we on this stage need to open our ears. we need to open our ears. the american people are not whispering to us. they are screaming to us. and they're screaming to us that it's our job to actually make this government work. it's so dysfunctional under barack obama and hillary clinton. it's so ineffective. it's so ineffectual that the american people say, we don't trust them to do anything anymore. so i'm not going to let syrian refugees, any syrian refugees in this country. and it was widows and orphans, by the way, and we now know from watching the san bernardino attack that women can commit heinous, heinous acts against humanity just the same as men can do it. and so i don't back away from that position for a minute. when the fbi director tells me that he can vet those people, then we'll consider it and not a moment before because your safety and security is what's most important to me.",1
"yes, i have a good record of voting for gun commonsense safety legislation, but the reality is, despite these tragedies that happen time and time again, when legislators step up to pass commonsense gun safety legislation, the gun lobby moves in and tells the people they're coming to take away your guns. and, they're successful at it, in colorado and others states, the legislators that vote for commonsense gun safety measures then get defeated. i even saw in rhode island. so, i would bring the gun lobby in and say we've got to change this. where can we find common ground? wayne lapierre from the nra, whoever it is, the leaders. come one, we've go to change this. we're not coming to take away your guns, we believe in the second amendment, but let's find common ground here.",0

"well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of america safe. i have a plan that i've put forward to go after isis. not to contain them, but to defeat them. and it has three parts. first, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both syria and iraq. secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism. and thirdly, to do more to keep us safe. under each of those three parts of my plan, i have very specific recommendations about what to do. obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an american-led air campaign, we have to have arab and kurdish troops on the ground. secondly, we've got to go after everything from north africa to south asia and beyond. and then, most importantly, here at home, i think there are three things that we have to get right. we have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information. that now includes the internet, because we have seen that isis is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence. that means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies. they can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists. we've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning. and we must work more closely with muslim-american communities. just like martin, i met with a group of muslim-americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization. they will be our early warning signal. that's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the republicans have been doing.",0
"no, of course not. and we don't have to in order to defeat terrorists. the way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward. it's difficult to do, but it has to be done. when i'm president of the united states, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung. they're going to be expanded. and the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists. and then the best military in the world, which needs to be rebuilt because -- because barack obama is gutting our military. he's going to leave us with the smallest army since the end of world war ii, and the smallest navy in a century, and the smallest air force we've ever had. we are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them. and if we capture any of these terrorists alive, they're not going to have the right to remain silent. and they're not going to go to a courtroom in manhattan. they're going to go to guantanamo bay, cuba and we will find out everything they know and we'll do so legally.",1

"i have said repeatedly, wolf, i am going to make the wealthy pay into social security to extend the social security trust fund. that is one way. if that is the way that we pursue, i will follow that. but there are other ways. we should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people. we should be looking at taxing all of their investment. but here's the real issue, because i -- i've heard this, i've seen the reports of it. i have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect social security. i was one of the leaders in the fight against bush when he was trying to privatize social security. but we also, in addition to extending the trust fund, which i am absolutely determined to do, we've got to help people who are not being taken care of now. and because social security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind. and it's time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the social security...",0
"i just think there's got to be a way, and i would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out. otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after. so we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but i know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe. and that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.",0

"well, you know, governor, i know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010. so for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08. and i will go back and say again, aig was not a big bank. it had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us. lehman brothers was not a big bank. it was an investment bank. and its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us. so i've said, if the big banks don't play by the rules, i will break them up.",0

"nancy, the blueprint in maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in america for five years in a row with that investment. and yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions. so while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, i actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a aaa bond rating, but the highest median income in america. i believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains. i believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil. and if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.",0
"well, i think we are in vigorous agreement on this. i have said repeatedly no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail. and i have said that i would use the tools in the dodd-frank regulations, that if any bank posed a systemic risk to the economy, they would be broken up. because we now have tools, laws that we didn't have before. and i am very happy we did. because there does need to be accountability, including criminal accountability if it is called for.",0
"well, i'm glad we're having a discussion about taxes because everybody laments that we lose jobs overseas, we have. our companies, and our jobs are being chased overseas by a 70,000 page tax code, so, that's why i've chosen to get rid of the whole thing, and have one single rate, 14 and a-half percent for everybody, business, and for corporate income, and personal income. but, we also get rid of the payroll tax, so the working class would get a tax break as well. so, i think a flat tax, eliminating the tax code, getting rid of all the loopholes, is the way to go, and it's the way we get america going again.",1

"there is no issue in american public policy that i have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in america. when i ran in 1999, david, for mayor of baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in america. but we came together. i brought people together over some very deep racial divides. and we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in america over the next ten years. as governor, we continued to work together. we reduced violent crime to 30-year lows. but get this. we also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows. so it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police. but there wasn't a single day as mayor of baltimore that i wasn't asked whether i was delivering on the promise i made to police the police. we reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force. in fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force. as a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable. just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force. there's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better. we need to do it now as a nation. this is our time and our opportunity to do that.",0

"yes, well, it does. but it's in the following way, this is an important question. i think if you're running for president, these are important issues, because look at around the world today. there is a lunatic in north korea with dozens of nuclear weapons and long-range rocket that can already hit the very place in which we stand tonight. the chinese are rapidly expanding their military. they hack into our computers. they're building artificial islands in the south china sea, the most important shipping lane in the world. a gangster in moscow is not just threatening europe, he's threatening to destroy and divide nato. you have radical jihadists in dozens of countries across multiple continents. and they even recruit americans using social media to try to attack us here at home. and now we have got this horrible deal with iran where a radical shia cleric with an apocalyptic vision of the future is also guaranteed to one day possess nuclear weapons and also a long-range rocket that can hit the united states. these are extraordinarily dangerous times that we live in. and the next president of the united states better be someone that understands these issues and has good judgment about them because the number one issue that a president will ever confront, and the most important obligation that the federal government has, is to keep this nation safe. and today we are not doing that. we are eviscerating our military. and we have a president that is more respectful to the ayatollah in iran than he is to the prime minister of israel.",1
"...is in trouble, but it's not beyond repair. but it's going to take leadership who sees the greatness of this country, and who believes that once again we can be one nation, under god. i'll be my best to do that, and thank you for your support.",1
"what we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about. we have to be honest about it. it is undermining american democracy. when extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to super pacs, and in many cases in this campaign, super pacs have raised more money than individual candidates have, ok? we had a decision to make early on, do we do a super pac? and, we said no. we don't represent wall street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up i'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no super pac. but, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something. and, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would i have believed that i would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people. now, secretary clinton's super pac, as i understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from wall street. our average contribution is $27 dollars, i'm very proud of that.",0
"...and we have to get smart. we can't continue to be the policeman of the world. we are $19 trillion dollars, we have a country that's going to hell, we have an infrastructure that's falling apart. our roads, our bridges, our schools, our airports, and we have to start investing money in our country.",1
"no, martha, i would not. and that's not what we did in maryland. but you know what we did in maryland? we overcame the nra's objections. we overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there. we did our own rallies. and at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country. isil videos, isil training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in america is at a gun show. and it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.",0
"john, may i -- may i interject here? secretary clinton also said we -- it was not just the invasion of iraq which secretary clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and, indeed, it was. but it was also the cascading effects that followed that. it was also the disbanding of many elements of the iraqi army that are now showing up as part of isis. it was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up. we need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict. it's not just about getting rid of a single dictator. it is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.",0
"you know, most of the property in florida will be at risk in the next 50 years. i think i can get a bipartisan consensus on resilience and then implementing the president's orders until we frankly win back enough seats, take back the senate, and get back to",0
"well, andrea, i am absolutely committed to universal health care. i have worked on this for a long time, people may remember that i took on the health insurance industry back in the '90s, and i didn't quit until we got the children's health insurance program that ensures eight million kids. and i certainly respect senator sanders' intentions, but when you're talking about health care, the details really matter. and therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people's health care? he didn't like that, his campaign didn't like it either. and tonight, he's come out with a new health care plan. and again, we need to get into the details. but here's what i believe, the democratic party and the united states worked since harry truman to get the affordable care act passed. we finally have a path to universal health care. we have accomplished so much already. i do not to want see the republicans repeal it, and i don't to want see us start over again with a contentious debate. i want us to defend and build on the affordable care act and improve it.",0
"ours is 14.5 percent for corporations, 14.5 percent for individuals. no payroll tax for the employee. the business tax pays for social security, and there would be two remaining deductions -- home mortgage and charity.",1
"so, look, we have disagreements on policy. there's no doubt about it. but if you go and read, which i hope all of you will before tuesday, senator sanders' long interview with the ""new york daily news,"" talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks. when asked, he could not explain",0
