that. we know what it takes to do that. it takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. it takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. it takes a mandatory e-verify system and a mandatory entry\/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. after we have done that, the second thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal immigration system. and after we have done those two things, i think the american people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn't otherwise violated our laws -- because if they're a criminal they can't stay. they'll have to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. and ultimately, they'll given a work permit and that's all they're gonna be allowed to have for at

i think we should have policies that don't allow them to just enlarge themselves at the expense of smaller entities. and certainly some of the policies, some of the monetary and fed policies that we're using makes it very easy for them, makes it very easy for the big corporations, quite frankly, at these very low interest rates to buy back their stock and to drive the price of that up artificially. those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place. and i think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation. this country was -- declared its independence in 1776. in less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. and the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. those are the fuels that drive it. and what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. if we can get that out, it makes a big difference. and even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. and it's shifted to the individual. so -- and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich. they go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it. and the middle class, when they come to the cash register, have a whole cart full of things that cost 5, 10 or 15 cents more, they notice it. it is hurting the poor. bernie sanders and hillary clinton won't tell you that that's the thing that's really hurting middle class in the core. they'll say it's the rich, take their money, but that won't help. you can take all of the rich's money and it won't make a dent in the problem that we're having. we have to come back to the fundamental principles that made america great.","class":1,"tokens":[0.1706767678,-1.7369450331,-0.9425335526,-0.6004204154,-0.3818049729,1.1692492962,-0.4495937824,-1.6167531013,-0.4641645253,0.7844961286,2.6530325413,-0.4086731374,-1.492749691,1.5917310715,-1.0052152872,-0.1570177823,-1.961165905,0.6522378922,0.0267266035,-0.4244881868,-1.9161599874,-1.2063525915,3.859817028,-0.1634672135,0.0618386641,0.8937596083,-1.7870289087,1.2675454617,-2.0664839745,-0.4504607022,3.1631567478,1.172647357,-1.7377647161,1.6571596861,1.0627895594,-0.4437804222,-0.0213394389,-0.3476964533,-1.3712213039,1.2693581581]},{"index":134,"text":"i'm

strengthened the tools of national security and law enforcement to go after terrorists. it gave us greater tools and we are seeing those tools work right now in san bernardino. and in particular, what

think what is extraordinary about my tax plan is it is in the context of balancing the budget. what is also extraordinary about my tax plan is it gets rid of the payroll tax. democrats demagogue this issue to death, and when they do they say, oh, a millionaire would get a bigger tax cut than someone making $10,000. that's proportionality, as ben is trying to explain to folks. but the thing is, is if we get rid of the payroll tax, everybody is going to get a tax cut. and this is something that i think the public at large will support and could win an election.","class":1,"tokens":[-1.4664971828,-0.5438280106,-2.4064464569,-0.3025036454,0.4848209321,-1.9019916058,0.5178096294,-1.439486742,0.5764425397,0.4305630326,0.0713096261,-1.7118902206,-0.7491600513,1.3232216835,0.1658498645,-0.9729415178,-3.2330489159,-1.3559674025,0.5543915629,1.2620611191,-0.5563111305,2.3057897091,2.0810694695,1.5283793211,1.3077015877,-1.2866476774,-1.219147563,1.0301241875,-0.4436270297,0.3860428929,-0.0679557472,0.1578595042,2.4885132313,-1.825637579,1.0820780993,0.7514874935,-0.3120753169,-1.696241498,-0.1889968067,-0.630302012]},{"index":178,"text":"yes,

they're actually talking now about negative interest. the money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in new york. and because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. so what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality. we also find that as the federal reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst. so really we need to reexamine whether we not -- we want a federal reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates. we also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse. but the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a

we're not even dreaming about going to college because they knew it was another world. so starting with the top, now i know some people think it's a radical idea, i don't. i believe that every public college and university in this country should be tuition free.","class":0,"tokens":[0.3565142751,-1.788192153,-2.0422036648,-2.3291089535,-0.5487903953,0.2021718025,-0.7772411108,0.0658142492,-0.7354348302,0.6823945642,-1.4794443846,0.6212328672,-0.7281277776,1.2075424194,0.1734507978,-0.7797381878,-2.4132080078,0.6247734427,1.1359878778,-0.6210311055,-0.1503432691,0.3727400005,0.857518971,0.1690943837,0.0466288514,1.5162941217,0.0024401755,-1.3364009857,-0.3666973114,1.1368459463,1.2911366224,-0.1549446434,0.2467527092,0.993144691,0.0502111651,-0.9527894855,0.7999917865,0.0164988451,0.7063230872,-0.5280466676]},{"index":301,"text":"well,

me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed. this nation is the most powerful military in the world. we're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism. we are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons. i think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us. the cold war is over. and our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets. so, in terms of refugees, i believe that the united states has the moral responsibility with europe, with gulf countries like saudi arabia to make

would be a grave mistake to ask for any more iranian troops inside syria. that is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire. the iranians getting more of a presence in syria, linking with hezbollah, their proxy in lebanon, would threaten israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with assad's

i'm glad you asked that, maria. here's -- here's our plan. we've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform. if you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know. and what that's led to over $2 trillion of american companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. and who can blame them? they pay tax once overseas. they don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back. so beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money. bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the united states. we'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. and i would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country. it would not necessitate us raising any taxes. it would bring the money back into the united states to help build jobs by american companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. and -- and -- and the last piece of this, maria, is this. you know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in america. he's penalized -- and doesn't understand. in fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers. you've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the obama administration. that's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. we'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively. and remember this -- i'm credible on this for this reason: americans for tax reform says that i've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in american history. we don't need to raise taxes to get this done. we need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the united states to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need

to provide the basic safety net support that american workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy. so it's not just what's in the trade agreement that i'm interested in. i did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from president bush with korea. we go the uaw on board because of changes we made. so there are changes that i believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but i do not currently support it as it is written.","class":0,"tokens":[0.0195560884,-1.9563275576,-0.7256830931,2.2041261196,-0.0525346771,1.1894162893,0.4602439702,0.3399091661,-0.0114471354,-0.7709417343,2.7256133556,-0.2024918944,-0.0261188038,-1.6301221848,-0.1324619949,0.2740654051,-1.20198071,1.7949950695,-0.514551878,0.910921216,1.0801050663,0.6918400526,0.7409504652,-0.2206656188,-1.4735438824,-0.6135876775,-0.5093919039,0.0167673845,-0.1128574684,3.1731126308,0.9886213541,-1.3015147448,3.7484068871,-3.1061339378,1.1139481068,2.2394545078,-1.1135725975,0.3138947189,-2.5951485634,1.2610435486]},{"index":537,"text":"but

that information was looked at. our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing. a few days ago a similar incident happened. there was a breach because the dnc vendor screwed up, information

we are doing away with private health insurance premiums. so, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to blue cross, or blue shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes,

individual mandate. he said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which i don't believe that should be part of it. that should not remain there. i think here's what we need to replace it with. we need to repeal obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts americans in charge of their health care money again. if your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in america they want to buy it from. otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country. and if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. and that, i think, is a much better approach than obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy. it is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time. it is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. and i will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all americans.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.9715386629,-0.0303778611,-0.3329665363,-0.8060814738,2.8941912651,-0.4650637507,0.5530802608,-0.677149713,-2.5298290253,1.1645190716,0.9780047536,-1.1587589979,-2.6497249603,-1.082131505,0.3051811755,0.2973159254,-2.2476451397,-1.3810232878,-0.6390070915,2.518666029,0.0520055518,-1.212678194,0.9602361321,0.6389482021,2.853682518,2.8200347424,1.2814445496,1.5080754757,-1.1027417183,2.8351919651,-2.0863587856,-0.4756598175,-0.2612909675,-0.6432722807,1.2238577604,-0.3129925132,1.5961846113,-3.8589863777,0.0030745016,1.5911234617]},{"index":852,"text":"well,

with respect to syria, i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made. the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria. the agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to. you know, the russians wanted to buy time. are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. but i would add this. you know, the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution. at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together. this is incredibly complicated, because we've got iran as a big player, in addition to russia. we have saudi arabia, turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. this is one of the areas i've disagreed with senator sanders on, who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria, which i think would be a grave mistake. putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me. trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. so let's support what secretary kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. and remember, the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups. so as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and the like. so we've got some

down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt. we also balanced the budget four years in a row. and we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then. i also had a plan in 1999 to save social security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have social security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts. now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a ufo than a social security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous. i have a plan to fix it that doesn't even require raising the retirement age. if you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on social security, you'll still get it. it will just simply be less. and for those people who depend on that social security, they'll get their full benefit. that's the way it will work. and we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age. and how do i know that? i've done all this before. this is not a theory. do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget? yes. it doesn't mean you have to cut them. it means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st century. so not only did we have a balanced budget in washington, but when i went to ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we're $2 billion in the black. our credit is strong. we're up 400,000 jobs. and i want to go back with the same formula to beat the washington insiders again. and i will get it done, and this country will be much stronger economically as a

businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now. the big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this. and what i think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise. the government has tried it their way. under -- under barack obama and the proposals of hillary clinton and bernie sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably. we need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.2662011981,-0.5327692628,0.640426755,-1.6128083467,0.1634677052,-1.09920156,-0.3265690207,-0.8094097376,-1.3157709837,-0.2134167552,0.1052075326,-2.2591125965,-1.6305547953,-0.1244283989,-1.1343892813,-1.9063600302,-3.2101192474,-0.321075201,-0.239961341,1.3309049606,-0.1368192881,-1.7479623556,1.9246333838,0.0608011,-0.4513216615,-2.4499495029,-2.2639510632,0.8829891086,0.1302259266,1.399405241,0.3156922758,-0.6672480106,-1.158778429,0.6574074626,0.5439808369,0.7607454658,0.4153717756,-2.0611271858,0.1345157474,0.0502506457]},{"index":996,"text":"i

wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of state. but what i want people to know is i went to wall street before the crash. i was the one saying you're going to

trying to beat me in this primary. they have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. hedge fund billionaires, karl rove, another billionaire, jumped in. and why are they doing that?

certainly shouldn't have a commander-in-chief who sends a message to our adversaries as to how far we're going to go, and how far we're willing to fight, so i'm not putting a troop number. what i'm saying is lift the political restrictions. when you do that, you empower our military personnel already there to work with the kurd and the sunni allies, to reclaim the territory taken by isis. and to do so in a way that allows that isis doesn't go back in syria, as we were just talking about here. that is the fundamental problem going forward. we have a president -- and hillary clinton was a part of this, by the way, who has made political decisions for our men and women in uniform. i want the men and women at home to know, if i'm commander-in-chief, i will only send you into harm's way when our national security is at risk. and if we do, you know you'll have our full support, the support of the american people, and you'll have a clear path for victory.","class":1,"tokens":[-1.2349946499,-0.3598446846,1.1431806087,-0.4121547341,-0.8106642365,0.8263164163,-0.9159016013,0.8248282075,-2.1687886715,-0.8373892903,1.2455101013,0.0977195874,0.1294381917,-1.2711082697,1.8981001377,-1.0268517733,0.4472583234,-0.6346578598,-0.0617756285,-1.2788740396,-1.586330533,-1.0457161665,2.5845713615,0.7435410619,0.0923243612,-4.3449854851,-0.6511669159,-1.1313080788,0.6701004505,-2.7656095028,0.1428747177,0.8192793131,2.3843660355,0.9127972126,-0.4441836774,1.8495345116,0.1755314916,0.2973214984,-2.4464142323,1.903015852]},{"index":1131,"text":"this

you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. but let me just say this. in terms of where we are right now, as you mention, rachel, in a number of national and state, including new hampshire. for example, the last poll i saw -- there may have been a new one -- last one i saw here in new hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. there were also pretty large margins in iowa and wisconsin. these are polls. polls go up. polls go down. but here's why i think i will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process. republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. i believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout. if there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the white house, but i think we regain the senate. we win governors' chairs up and down the line. so i believe if you want to retain the white house, if you want to see democrats do well across the board, i think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us

with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them. but, what secretary carter is looking at is the constant pressure that russia's putting on our european allies. the way that russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-world war ii europe. the way that he is trying to set european countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in crimea. beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the baltics. we know that they are deeply engaged in supporting assad because they want to have a place in the middle east. they have a naval base, they have an air base in syria. they want to hang on to that. i think what secretary carter is seeing, and i'm glad he is, is that we got to get nato back working for the common defense. we've got to do more to

the chinese as well. and we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and i think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have

do that, we're stuck with the \"new normal\" of 2 percent growth. hillary clinton says, basically, we just gotta get used to it. two percent growth means declining income for the middle class. it means more than 6 million people are stuck in poverty than the day that barack obama was inaugurated. it means -- it means more demands on government -- growing the economy is the first job, if we're going to be serious about dealing with the deficit and debt. and more importantly, people are really struggling right now. in this economy, the disposable income of the great middle is down 2,300 bucks. so yeah, we've created jobs, your -- argue -- brought that up early, and it was a good question. jobs are being created, but they're lower-income jobs than the jobs that were lost. and the net

have suppressed people's aspirations. the increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life. we saw that in egypt. we saw a dictator overthrown. we saw a muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back. so, i think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the middle east.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.0568652377,-0.4860950708,0.0961405262,-1.3889011145,-1.085970521,1.575782299,0.0877594501,1.9204707146,-0.2262938321,0.6644404531,0.1699696779,-0.4060749114,-0.2893403471,-0.0597439744,0.8748921156,-2.6021633148,1.1340357065,1.3669587374,0.65879637,-1.134724617,-0.1021963358,-0.6929785609,0.7900637388,-0.5660349131,0.0783136338,-2.1797204018,-0.5125423074,-0.7817441225,-1.4856194258,-0.1557675749,0.3113947213,0.8871535659,1.855001092,0.2124876529,0.0776358172,0.8258377314,-0.6025787592,-0.0122342808,-0.7187336087,0.7141826749]},{"index":1425,"text":"well, first of all, healthcare is not a right. but i do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that. we spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do. i propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats. and we give it to everybody from birth until death. they can pass it on when they die. we pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. we give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. so dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle. and it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. it gives you enormous flexibility. and also, you know, if uncle joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody's going to hide his cigarettes because they're all interested in what's going on there. also, the -- your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare. so, it's like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered. one costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year. you can buy the $1,500 one. that will take care of 75 percent of the people. the people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now? medicaid. what's the medicaid budget? almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which i hope we get a chance to talk about. but do the math. over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all -- they will have a lot more flexibility. what could

i have what i call the new college compact. because i think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know. number one, states have been dis-investing in higher education. in fact, i think new hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country. so states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education. so under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system. secondly, i don't believe in free tuition for everybody. i believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead. so i have proposed debt free tuition, which i think is affordable and i would move a lot of the pell grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense. so i put all of this together, again, on my website and i've gotten such a good response. but i want to quickly say, one of the areas that senator sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems. free college, a single payer system for health--and it's been estimated we're looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget. and i have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run. and i think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that i have proposed i will tell you exactly how i'm going to pay for it; including college.","class":0,"tokens":[0.3922908008,3.1714560986,-0.5852634907,-1.4757237434,-0.9476113319,-1.8468921185,0.3233825266,-1.0881626606,1.8600364923,-0.4140363932,0.7913481593,-1.992541194,-1.0319336653,3.0075492859,-1.7372688055,-1.2489027977,-2.416561842,0.3254409134,1.7571638823,0.8881480098,-0.1329596192,-2.5995371342,2.07766819,-2.2061591148,2.7285249233,1.0927329063,-1.1996338367,0.5869499445,-0.5686298609,1.769518137,-0.9962930679,0.2531371713,0.5875188708,1.2666403055,1.8672450781,1.4972484112,1.5972896814,0.0123308823,0.6905440092,1.0336843729]},{"index":1604,"text":"well,

not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills. when my parents came, they had a very limited education. my father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died

let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they're related. as i've said many times before, my parents were never rich people. my father was a bartender. my mother was a maid. they worked for a living. but they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves. we call that the american dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. it is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people. what makes america special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful. the problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. if i thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, i would be all for it, but it isn't. in the 20th century, it's a disaster. if you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine. and that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated. here's the best way to raise wages. make america the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. for the life of me, i don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education. welders make more money than philosophers. we need more welders and less philosophers.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.7401991487,-0.2868633866,0.1263103485,-1.651201725,-1.4614742994,-0.4791583717,-1.2980926037,-2.2928195,-0.6945128441,-0.9506827593,-0.3988725841,-2.4841082096,-1.1267250776,-1.6595420837,-2.2977852821,-2.0327575207,-1.1590847969,-0.1060125306,0.2940252423,0.8432185054,-1.5691648722,-0.2955528796,2.7286286354,-0.1935796142,1.3529503345,2.6421120167,-0.6519022584,-0.9482972622,1.42251122,2.9338989258,0.0323662497,-0.2730869651,-1.1816245317,0.8408175111,1.3705595732,-0.3425088823,-0.2911421061,-0.151873976,-0.2010374665,1.2586737871]},{"index":1691,"text":"you

particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her god-given potential. i've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and i've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. at the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them. and then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one. right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. so i have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair

me -- let me just say this. what a president of the united states has got to do and what is his or her major, i think, responsibility is to, a, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values, that we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity. i voted against the war in iraq because i listened very carefully to what president bush and vice president cheney had to say and i didn't believe them. and if you go to my web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what i feared would happen when i spoke on the floor of the house, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. now i think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where secretary clinton and i disagree is the area of regime change. look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the united states, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. and god only knows saddam hussein was a brutal dictator. we could overthrow assad tomorrow if we wanted to. we got rid of gadhafi. but the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after. and in libya, for example, the united states, secretary clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi. but what happened is a political vacuum developed. isis came in, and now occupies significant territory in libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. but this is nothing new. this has gone on 50 or 60 years where the united states has been involved in overthrowing governments. mossadegh back in 1953. nobody knows who mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of iran. he was overthrown by british and american interests because he threatened oil interests of the british. and as a result of that, the shah of iran came in, terrible dictator. the result of that, you had the iranian revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. unintended consequences. so i believe as president i will look very carefully about unintended consequences. i will do everything i can to make certain that the united states and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the middle east.","class":0,"tokens":[0.5570691824,-0.5003138185,-1.3786820173,1.3702696562,-1.7152266502,-0.8045940995,-3.0757100582,1.2788161039,-0.0241252352,2.1734845638,0.1019832864,-0.3379460275,0.3611378372,-0.1059411168,0.8981428146,-0.3396329284,0.8668743372,2.0424280167,2.4028124809,0.8320108056,-0.236343205,-2.3352808952,1.2785661221,-0.8695522547,-2.0644533634,-1.191880703,1.3037643433,-1.7275823355,-0.9399861097,-0.4437938929,-1.1180647612,1.3767111301,1.914788723,-0.7423557639,0.2810361385,1.8341083527,0.8391331434,1.8032524586,-3.5316035748,-0.6314302087]},{"index":1835,"text":"as
