you very much, anderson. and thanks to all the viewers who tuned in tonight. i think what you did see is that, in this debate, we tried to deal with some of the very tough issues facing our country.

improve the lives of the american people? who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done? now, i revere my late mother, and she gave me a lot of good advice. but one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was, you know, the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down. it's whether you get back up. america's been knocked down. that great recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth disappeared. and although we've made progress, we're standing but not running the way america needs to. my mission as president will be to raise incomes for hard-working middle-class families and to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain i was raised with: if you work hard and you do your part, you should be

haven't had a raise in decades. you have small businesses in america that are struggling. for the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting. we have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies. and our adversaries continue to grow stronger. we have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in washington? we have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford. the time to act is now. the time to turn the page is now. if we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in american history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.8410724998,0.1949256957,-0.0419682041,-1.5906170607,0.2633775771,1.2830911875,0.2111972123,0.8827561736,-0.2362291217,-2.0986945629,-2.4457650185,-0.4302639067,-1.1911633015,-0.7785481215,1.8155682087,-1.739102602,-0.9747163653,1.5439807177,-1.6704562902,0.1646101922,-0.2560172379,0.3218871057,0.1452368498,-0.2870858908,-0.5930720568,-0.9542669058,1.2914977074,0.4673210382,0.8803691864,-1.5676110983,-0.2548134327,0.3601454198,0.0400171094,1.7545653582,-0.197084561,-0.4185441136,0.0904521421,-0.108547695,-0.7793542147,-0.3532756567,-0.3367789984,-1.0926710367,0.8218612075,-0.6083207726,-0.6030150056,-1.6815140247,0.2498609573,1.152371645,0.0195950866,-1.4535273314,2.2099277973,0.1893013418,1.4816570282,0.4877268672,0.7706805468,-0.4939986169,0.3715493381,-0.3390900493,0.8827625513,-0.4744485319,0.4641858041,0.3139754832,-0.2893150151,0.3280757666,-1.9763921499,1.8438811302,0.2664888203,0.7265687585,-0.1573066562,0.3317964673]},{"index":49,"text":"but

with respect to syria, i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made. the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria. the agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to. you know, the russians wanted to buy time. are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. but i would add this. you know, the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution. at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together. this is incredibly complicated, because we've got iran as a big player, in addition to russia. we have saudi arabia, turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. this is one of the areas i've disagreed with senator sanders on, who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria, which i think would be a grave mistake. putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me. trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. so let's support what secretary kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. and remember, the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups. so as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and the like. so we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the russians.","class":0,"tokens":[2.4629034996,-3.5797092915,2.0056507587,0.3379963338,1.8036782742,0.6174199581,3.0560810566,1.2421262264,-0.1812562495,0.3598735332,-2.1454493999,-0.7174042463,-0.2734357119,-1.4318618774,0.3168171644,1.3626674414,-0.8439317346,-2.2366085052,0.3972631693,0.7379004955,-0.4239100814,-1.2507476807,-1.1765493155,0.3536353409,0.121449165,1.7849650383,3.2183003426,2.1514546871,-0.1033799574,0.2210327238,1.7246768475,-0.018926261,0.7662061453,-0.811655581,1.358079195,-0.13525258,-1.3354011774,-0.8761734366,0.668520391,-2.7010173798,0.2967631221,-0.085176304,-0.7231120467,1.2008264065,0.2266180664,-2.1448071003,2.931137085,-1.7086646557,0.6856627464,0.5842859745,2.8804879189,-3.1554291248,0.3022714257,-1.4779028893,1.8930780888,1.580296278,-0.85682863,0.1440678239,-0.1323210299,1.5108499527,-3.5535268784,0.418718785,0.5268304348,-0.1227810308,-1.7542396784,-2.0775797367,1.2304067612,0.8043442965,2.4377572536,2.1827032566]},{"index":137,"text":"alright.

some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. i think what president obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first african american president,

free.","class":0,"tokens":[0.1222203523,-0.853754282,-1.0549538136,-1.1597760916,0.9500876069,-0.6909964085,-1.0348103046,-0.3664254844,0.24966456,1.8055865765,-1.2685354948,-1.4443204403,-0.1755321324,-0.0367432199,0.8294495344,0.7349073887,-0.927323103,-0.0562129579,-1.3727185726,-0.724783361,0.7553722858,0.1080624685,0.8183006644,-0.3162989318,-0.3727775514,-1.0555868149,0.6590722799,-0.8571203947,0.2501603663,-0.430606842,-1.1293777227,0.7429890037,0.0448344387,0.1784180552,-0.0701627061,-1.1052814722,1.1568425894,0.0750414655,-1.2730195522,0.133799687,0.0434103906,-0.7642680407,0.0049939924,-0.761182189,0.4708145857,-1.6604117155,-0.4999287128,-0.0401755497,-0.2312038988,0.1318605989,-1.2105206251,1.6678074598,0.3433821201,-0.0567259826,-0.3165914714,-1.2766604424,-0.6192557812,-0.4626541436,0.0809689611,-0.1157313138,-0.4010275602,-1.2999913692,1.2394353151,0.1676556468,0.459821105,-1.0427722931,0.2938055396,0.8505445719,-0.0643766373,0.8117675781]},{"index":161,"text":"we're

sector.","class":1,"tokens":[0.570530951,-0.4135359824,-1.3994492292,0.6029227376,0.6708999872,-0.4804091156,-0.1926780045,0.4342564344,-0.1712004989,-1.2151440382,0.2742837071,-0.9274455309,-0.7655216455,-0.7684702277,0.7074391246,0.0000105797,0.2151136398,-0.0174110103,-0.2385730296,0.882820785,0.707126677,0.8144161701,-0.835269928,-0.3050224781,0.6143181324,0.3998311758,1.300866127,0.3842879534,0.1791991442,-0.2280105948,-1.795118928,0.0101309987,0.696229279,1.1378334761,-0.8168296218,-1.6217465401,-0.742254734,-0.1355555058,-0.8418177366,0.7244278193,-0.1407684982,-0.4637845755,-0.801019609,-1.370033741,-0.4754613638,0.0707834885,0.399525404,-0.61729002,-0.0599257685,-0.8749853969,-1.136382699,0.1951961964,1.0216386318,0.8999791741,0.090843536,1.4354622364,0.9443005323,-1.1275887489,-0.5446029902,0.3940631747,0.0898432657,-0.9633456469,0.6119366288,-0.0876403004,0.1045894623,0.1593817323,-0.6035997272,-0.279927671,-0.4393031001,-0.0648607984]},{"index":175,"text":"well,

i have what i call the new college compact. because i think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know. number one, states have been dis-investing in higher education. in fact, i think new hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country. so states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education. so under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system. secondly, i don't believe in free tuition for everybody. i believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead. so i have proposed debt free tuition, which i think is affordable and i would move a lot of the pell grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense. so i put all of this together, again, on my website and i've gotten such a good response. but i want to quickly say, one of the areas that senator sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems. free college, a single payer system for health--and it's been estimated we're looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget. and i have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run. and i think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that i have proposed i will tell you exactly how i'm going to pay for it; including college.","class":0,"tokens":[0.0908129886,0.4596042037,-0.6103383303,0.2343264818,0.4204580188,-0.1378247142,0.4066800177,1.1946408749,-1.2711037397,-0.1289213002,-0.4060204923,0.6110901833,-0.1937338561,-0.2689751387,-1.3711619377,0.4218962789,0.8018437624,0.9895918369,-1.5701793432,-2.4224822521,0.9518914819,1.0765112638,-2.0387041569,0.5380461216,1.260627389,1.3377944231,0.7070533037,0.4626080096,4.0312390327,0.547252655,-0.2622885108,-1.7670693398,-1.2345062494,1.6927154064,0.4988906085,-2.7366259098,0.0421029292,-2.500944376,-1.4640954733,0.5863910317,0.5032737255,0.7587926984,-0.4561566114,-3.777518034,0.8291820884,0.4721851349,0.5360199809,-0.3620978296,-0.4914729893,-1.4450907707,-3.1339547634,1.15284729,0.863024354,0.2783834338,1.7480493784,1.2334262133,0.0766371042,-0.1704664826,-0.7767902017,-0.4910182357,-1.7992808819,-1.297743082,1.7301828861,-0.0231022183,-2.1981153488,-3.4074513912,1.3760737181,0.6161628366,0.4837774932,-0.0623824559]},{"index":248,"text":"yes,

terrorist movements to move in there. and the third was the recent deal allowing iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region

has been a resurgence of sunni activities, as exemplified by isis. and we have to support sunni-arab and kurdish forces against isis, because i believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the united states to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what isis wants. they've advertised that. they want american troops back

not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after. and in libya, for example, the united states, secretary clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi. but what happened is a political vacuum developed. isis came in, and now occupies significant territory in libya,

me tell you this, mr. baker, in terms of the cyber attacks, we have the capability to not only have a defensive posture, but it also to make it clear to people that if you attack us with cyber attacks, we will destroy the mechanisms that you are using to attack us. i want to give you a little trip around the world. i served on the defense committee for 18 years. in the ukraine, arm the people there so they can fight for themselves. in the eastern part of europe, make sure that finland and the baltics know that if the russians move, we move. in syria, yes, a no-fly zone in the north on the turkish border, a no-fly zone on the south on the jordanian border. anybody flies in the first time, maybe they can fly out. they fly in there a second time, they will not fly out. and it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be. and it also sends many messages in the middle east that we're still involved. saudi arabia, cut off the funding for the radical clerics, the ones that preach against us. but they're fundamentally our friends. jordan, we want the king to reign for 1,000 years. egypt, they have been our ally and a moderating force in the middle east throughout their history. in the groups -- in the countries of the gulf states of bahrain, the cleveland clinic is opening an operation. clearly we see the same with them. and in israel, we have no better ally in the world, and no more criticizing them in public, we should support them. and finally china, china doesn't own the south china sea, and i give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more. and in the trade agreement, the tpp, it's critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the chinese. they are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend. and finally, i will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics. when the fall comes, and we run against hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected. i have two 16-year-old girls, and i want this country to be strong. we make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble. we must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid. i served in washington as the chairman of the budget committee, and we got the budget balanced. and in ohio, as the ceo, and guess what, we have got to have a ceo mentality and a way to beat hillary clinton and the democracies in the fall. and our ideas have to add up. they have to be solid. and people have to know we have the confidence to lead america. and as president, i will lead this country, as i have before in washington and in ohio, and will return both on domestic and international affairs. and i appreciate the opportunity to speak this time, gerry.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.6204073429,-0.3095192909,1.9184213877,-2.6670620441,-0.0110835591,-0.7679309249,-0.8540145755,0.0262303874,0.6694369912,-0.7916274667,0.0334865674,-1.1685725451,-0.9922080636,1.1977812052,1.6394160986,0.7777902484,0.1242270172,-0.5153196454,-0.6276567578,0.370847851,-0.3610342443,0.4725885689,0.5076512694,0.6128594875,-0.9502363801,1.9235147238,3.007267952,-2.4036889076,-0.0451729111,-0.1713403612,-0.0711021572,0.2882147729,1.0184024572,1.6434031725,-0.7388493419,-0.428068012,1.8158245087,-2.3935744762,-1.5068296194,0.5286323428,-0.1496144086,-2.3840942383,-0.4540958703,-0.2225611061,0.3243061304,-2.4084854126,1.4520251751,0.504732728,0.5883269906,0.4776977301,3.4707942009,0.2714506686,-0.5883684158,-2.0956532955,2.687015295,0.8238066435,-1.357293725,1.4709688425,-0.5555490851,-1.9903072119,1.2205492258,1.0866496563,2.8901188374,0.873072803,0.3292779624,-0.9741671085,-0.7483563423,1.7303613424,0.6853058934,1.2732030153]},{"index":670,"text":"well,

let me begin by saying that we have to understand who isis is. isis is a radical sunni group. they cannot just be defeated through air strikes. air strikes are a key component of defeating them, but they must be defeated on the ground by a ground force. and that ground force must be primarily made up of sunni arabs themselves, sunni arabs that reject them ideologically and confront them militarily. we will have to embed additional american special operators alongside them to help them with training, to help them conduct special missions, and to help improve the air strikes. the air strikes are important, but we need to have an air force capable of it. and because of the budget cuts we are facing in this country, we are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest air force we have ever had. we have to reverse those cuts, in addition to the cuts to our navy and in addition to the cuts to our army, as well. and beyond that, i would say we must win the information war against isis. every war we have ever been involved in has had a propaganda informational aspect to it. isis is winning the propaganda war. they are recruiting people, including americans, to join them, with the promise that they are joining this great apocalyptic movement that is going to defeat the west. we have to show what life is really like in isis territory, and we have to show them why isis is not invincible, by going out and conducting these attacks and publicizing them to those who they

mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor, the developmental disabled, and we have raised our minority community. and as president of the united states, i will go back to washington, i will take the formulas that i used, and i will -- i will fix the problems in washington, and you'll work with me as i send you power to fix your -- your communities, your neighborhoods, your state, and together, we'll restore the spirit of america. and i know you want that. thank you.","class":1,"tokens":[0.4476246238,-0.1457426399,0.909863472,-1.2930161953,-1.2164856195,0.4707977772,0.1816312969,0.5064088106,0.4501297474,0.5008993745,-1.6886558533,0.5030029416,-1.2734011412,-0.1627556533,0.4680994749,0.1981461197,0.6507232785,-1.1242523193,-0.7965781689,-0.9025222659,-0.2985493243,-0.5217035413,-0.0390246026,-0.0415991433,0.0402128324,0.5769231319,0.2590444684,-0.4538653195,0.6111201644,-0.3078939319,-0.6039842963,0.850543201,0.8973531127,2.7035090923,-0.6920084357,-0.4209823906,-0.5839989185,-0.0183716882,-0.6640460491,0.8420779705,-0.3136600852,-1.2901251316,-1.5973395109,-1.0873603821,1.0731945038,-1.7441390753,-0.4827992618,0.5780155063,-0.742292583,-2.350881815,-0.4803133309,0.6294184923,0.6884609461,-0.6881038547,-0.1932276636,2.3957984447,0.5637326837,0.5670142174,2.3741281033,0.2792525887,-1.7536152601,0.1833013594,-0.3291587532,1.3357901573,-0.7695391178,-0.2076263577,0.7295746207,-0.0450519845,0.1783292741,-1.1732224226]},{"index":857,"text":"i've

leave.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.1837880313,-0.74020648,-1.2557952404,0.5077522397,-0.0893919393,-0.8477582932,1.4918622971,-0.0964164585,-0.1156511307,0.7848625779,-0.5418080091,-0.979059875,-0.2970898747,-0.1684511155,0.2696803212,0.1281922162,-0.3148311377,-0.4681634307,-0.6877450943,-0.0056740134,1.1427289248,-0.5262073278,0.0894385278,-0.736925602,0.4661219418,-0.4056836367,-0.0717537701,0.8505085111,-0.0700342581,-0.4114197791,-0.0951918513,0.1399028301,0.1057089344,0.4242362082,0.4344566762,-0.1595740616,0.877365768,0.4876595438,0.1165506467,0.2409958988,0.1283945143,0.1053472757,-0.2378587574,-0.0221936647,0.7848821878,-0.1885475516,0.4894145429,0.3883304,0.6741316915,0.7605037093,0.0870040134,-0.0282840505,1.1740055084,0.7143207788,0.6361992359,0.1226396263,0.3221002519,0.2400182635,0.71441257,-0.7106609344,-0.0824441165,-0.7510032058,1.1532024145,-0.0845119134,0.697892487,-0.8191415668,0.7413939834,-0.0966207087,-0.1308081299,0.0173267946]},{"index":878,"text":"well, i'm glad you asked that, maria. here's -- here's our plan. we've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform. if you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know. and what that's led to over $2 trillion of american companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. and who can blame them? they pay tax once overseas. they don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back. so beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money. bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the united states. we'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. and i would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country. it would not necessitate us raising any taxes. it would bring the money back into the united states to help build jobs by american companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. and -- and -- and the last piece of this, maria, is this. you know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in america. he's penalized -- and doesn't understand. in fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers. you've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the obama administration. that's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. we'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively. and remember this -- i'm credible on this for this reason: americans for tax reform says that i've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in american history. we don't need to raise taxes to get this done. we need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the united states to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists. all of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a christie administration.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.1667776555,-1.0791627169,0.9496272802,-2.2736792564,0.4703254998,2.950145483,0.711558044,1.1810903549,0.9897286892,-0.0508696288,-2.4367022514,0.3333417177,-1.8842785358,-0.7241113186,1.7826778889,-1.4495339394,-1.9171715975,0.0483286008,-0.8756945729,0.6587679982,-1.2262117863,0.4060615003,0.2123124301,0.9657221437,-0.1341991425,0.3842518628,0.5251182318,-0.1233726814,2.5263893604,0.1930610538,0.2969184816,-1.5639635324,-1.3297437429,0.7618353963,0.6783527732,0.1387410909,-1.969836235,0.4051584005,-0.54136765,3.3851783276,1.2747449875,-1.9749070406,-0.0315283015,-2.7396309376,-1.7817106247,-0.6964119077,2.4669206142,-1.0960401297,-0.5796573162,-2.4511663914,1.0871808529,-0.0978613421,0.4850596488,2.4814937115,-0.8754895329,0.7297219038,0.9826432467,-1.5553451777,-0.6706927419,-2.4856545925,0.4899431169,-1.3269942999,0.6336968541,0.2136856169,3.381518364,-1.230796814,-0.439858228,-0.2375373393,-1.5127032995,-1.7237751484]},{"index":879,"text":"can

neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves. we call that the american dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. it is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people. what makes america special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard

everybody from birth until death. they can pass it on when they die. we pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. we give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. so dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle. and it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. it

isis poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the sunni tribes in anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the kurds to provide them the support, but they're doing the fighting. we're doing the support and

up to them, we didn't back down in any of those instances. if you give me the chance as your next president, i won't back down any day, anyway, anyhow. i'll fight and win for you and your families

we are doing away with private health insurance premiums. so, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to blue cross, or blue shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes,

african-american single mom who started a tax preparation business in the south side of chicago. she found a store front, she wanted to have her own business. she started a business. but then the irs promulgated new regulations targeting tax preparers. they did it under a more than 100-year-old statute called the dead horse act. now, this statute and the irs in classic washington crony fashion had exemptions for lawyers and big fancy accountants, but sabina had to pay $1,000 an employee. it would have driven her out of business, and ms. loving sued the irs. she took the obama irs to court, and

run by democrats and countries currently run by democrats. so the thing is, let's look for root causes. but i would also say -- lay some blame at the -- the feet of the federal reserve. i think the federal reserve has made this problem worse. by artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money. they're actually talking now about negative interest. the money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in new york. and because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. so what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality. we also find that as the federal reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst. so really we need to reexamine whether we not -- we want a federal reserve that's involved so much

first of all, in ohio we're changing the whole system. universities will not get paid one dime unless the student graduates or -- graduates or completes a course. secondly, you can be in high school and complete almost an entire first year before you go to college and get credit to do that. and, of course, in addition to that, we are working now to go after the cost drivers in our universities. and let me give you an example. universities today have so many non-academic assets. at ohio state they sold the parking garage and the parking lot, and they got $500 million because they shouldn't be in the parking lot business. they shouldn't be in the ding business, they shouldn't be in the dorm business. and, of course, we need to take advantage of on-line education to reduce these costs and begin to dis-intermediate the cost of four years. now, for those who that have these big high costs, i think we can seriously look at an idea of where you can do public service. i mean legitimate, public service and begin to pay off some of that debt through the public service that you do. and in the meantime, it may inspire us to care more about our country, more about ourselves. this is a big

me go answer mr. mcghee's question because i think it's a profound one. i think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when i was a teenager, insisting that we go in to inner-city chicago because i lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches. it was also important for me to be a baby-sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear dr. king speak in chicago when i was about 14 years old. that got me thinking about what i needed to do to try to fulfill my faith. when i was in law school, i had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named mary right adelman, who worked with dr. king who was the first african-american woman who passed the mississippi bar. i asked her for a job and she said she didn't have any money. i was working my way through law school and she said if i could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. so i got law students a civil rights research council grant. the first thing she did was send me to look at south carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. the second thing she did was to send me to alabama to investigate segregated academies. so from that moment until today, i am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the children's defense fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything i can to address systemic racism.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.8279157877,-1.130693078,-2.1664466858,1.0145052671,0.2496898323,-0.4451521933,0.5757309198,-0.3626478314,0.0377796292,1.2909139395,-0.619124651,-0.2498095632,-1.4817103148,-1.3415821791,-0.0937802047,-0.9991073012,0.6412463784,-1.1103996038,0.4882883728,-0.9795998335,0.3751100898,-1.0829731226,-0.2699222565,0.7937943339,2.2333848476,-0.5473646522,0.3173962533,2.7364842892,-0.4406998754,0.5235807896,-1.4667575359,0.0785999149,-1.1615803242,1.5032923222,-0.0749696866,-2.8999664783,1.1559768915,2.583473444,-0.516933322,-0.1841329932,0.2007922083,0.4487657249,0.3549927473,1.5147634745,1.6347829103,-0.8262139559,1.5878132582,-1.3138514757,-1.0005282164,-2.4762423038,-1.0331197977,2.8199136257,-0.3979865015,-1.0494891405,-0.5439964533,2.8709731102,0.3562119007,0.3576947153,1.0130835772,2.3606731892,0.3978639543,-2.0857877731,2.8526182175,0.0039754785,-0.701913476,-1.3425722122,-0.2471099943,2.6767551899,-0.0024106896,-0.4997604489]},{"index":1333,"text":"no,

save and redeem lives, and to do more of them, and to stop doing the things that don't. for my part, that's what i have done in 15 years of experience as a mayor and as a governor. we restored voting rights to 52,000 people. we decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana. i repealed the death penalty. and we also put in place a civilian review board. we reported openly discourtesy, and lethal force and brutality complaints. this is something that -- and i put forward a new agenda for criminal justice reform that is informed by that experience. so as president, i would lead these efforts, and i would do so with more experience and probably the attendance at more grave sites than any of the three of us on this stage when it comes to urban crime, loss of lives. and the truth is

i am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in america, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths. people with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived. this is a remarkable and horrifying fact. and that's why i've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal. you know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us? do people not care about all of our sacrifice? and i'm going to do everything i can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country. i particularly appreciate the proposal that congressman jim clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. and you know what? if you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out. so, yes, i do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is. and

a governor. as mayor, i brought labor peace to my city and kept taxes down. i was reelected three times. as a senator, i earned a reputation for courageous votes against the bush-cheney tax cuts the

reverse course by creating a strategy of high sustained economic growth, not the new normal of 2 percent that all the left says we just have to get used to, but a 4 percent growth strategy where we reform how we tax, fix the broken regulatory system, embrace the energy revolution in our midst, fix the immigration system so we can turn it into an economic driver, deal with the structural fiscal problems that exist because of our entitlement problems that will overwhelm and create way too much debt. if we grow at 4 percent, people are going to be lifted out of poverty. the great middle that

have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining american democracy, which allows wall street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice. and aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. and that's an economy where ordinary americans are working longer hours for low wagers. they are

settlements and get no prosecution at all. no criminal records for them. i think what our campaign is indicating is that the american people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. they want a political revolution in which millions of americans stand up, come together, not let the trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a

you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. the children's health insurance program, which i helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is

you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. but let me just say this. in terms of where we are right now, as you mention, rachel, in a number of national and state,

defeating him by one. there were also pretty large margins in iowa and wisconsin. these are polls. polls go up. polls go down. but here's why i think i will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process. republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. i believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout. if there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the white house, but i think we regain the senate. we win governors' chairs up and down the line. so i believe if you want to retain the white house, if you want to see democrats do well across the board, i think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us

little children coming to this country -- on their own, very often -- many of them not making it. and when they got here, they needed, as i have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision. we need to end private detention, we need to end family detention. and in 2006, when senator sanders was running for the senate from vermont, he voted in the house with hard-line republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those republicans to stand with vigilantes known as minute men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants. so i think when you were running for the senate, you made it clear by your vote, senator, that you were going to stand with the republicans. when you got to the senate in 2007, one of the first things you did was vote against ted kennedy's immigration reform which he'd been working on for years before you ever

jobs. i want to take care of women. when the social security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. and women have been disadvantaged ever since. they do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. and the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their social security monthly payment. so

him against george w. bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment. and i'll give one more example on israel. when the obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of israel, when hamas was raining rockets down on them, i publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against israel? the next day michael bloomberg, another new york billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to israel from london. together the heat and light that was put on the state department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into israel.

you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess. that is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare. because if you think about your own deductibles today, they're going higher, higher and higher. and you know what? at some point, people can't afford it. our plan will work. it uses the market. it uses transparency. it gets the patient in the middle. and guess what? we're actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country. and if this will go -- this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on. we will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in america and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition. we don't want to throw millions of people out into the

this is a place where the private sector could be helpful because the government is woefully behind the technology curve. but secondly, the bureaucratic processes that have been in place since 9\/11

you didn't go out and get a cab? he said, no, i don't get cabs in washington, d.c. this was 20 years ago. because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. i couldn't believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in washington, d.c. tell you another story, i was with young people active in the black lives

just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we've got to hold police officers accountable, i'm just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people. so to answer your question, i would say, and i think it's similar to what the secretary said, when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto. you don't know what it's like to be poor. you don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car. and i believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be

where i would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how i would move this agenda forward. i've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because i feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, gwen, that you are mentioning. there is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government. i'm aware of that. it comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum. so we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why i think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, i think, alienate americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.","class":0,"tokens":[1.484646678,-0.4867198169,-1.6807698011,-0.6510962844,0.7191535234,2.4480454922,-0.3886340559,0.8644645214,-0.4462544024,0.3561703861,-0.5244158506,1.0283418894,-0.7929728031,-1.0149761438,-0.552878499,1.4323245287,-0.056518279,-0.2503246963,-0.8285759091,1.0752931833,-0.0928559601,-0.2427901626,-1.4903818369,-0.5459454656,-0.0298012998,-1.0930039883,0.5563389659,-0.451017648,-0.8158652186,-0.1411505193,-0.0437184423,-0.7486874461,-0.4535265267,-1.213113308,-0.4871515036,-1.2753555775,-1.0085719824,-0.2464811206,-0.4233952165,0.5859755278,0.4900192022,-0.5723341703,-0.7209338546,0.5173629522,1.5931700468,-1.4566180706,0.9421465397,-0.5758091211,0.4885927141,0.2032935172,0.0405697115,-0.0486039594,0.953694284,0.4703907371,1.5811780691,0.1339626461,2.4294776917,-0.9909749627,-0.0539085604,0.7496379614,0.5682309866,-0.1789181978,1.0391522646,0.0522033013,-0.9476515651,-0.4140129387,0.070262976,1.3617898226,-0.2463650256,2.0775251389]},{"index":1737,"text":"the

have to prevent the republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made. they would repeal the affordable care act, not improve it. they would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and

you what happens. you know, we've seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, smoot- hawley led to the great depression. and the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent. but not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the american people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs. a much better solution that works is the tax plan i've laid out which would enable our

trying to move the boundaries of the post-world war ii europe. the way that he is trying to set european countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in crimea. beginning to explore
