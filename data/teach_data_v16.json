this stage, the real problem is barack obama has had six years to advocate a position to fix this and he's done nothing. the congress has funded these programs of building more fencing and doing all this and he hasn't done it. he wants to maintain it as a wedge issue and so does hillary clinton. republicans need to fix it and when we do, we'll be better off.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.6433238983,0.1546114981,0.5754316449,0.5371047258,-0.183223784,0.3176924288,-0.5671132803,0.178092584,0.5165764093,-1.9449186325,-1.2641018629,0.2448396087,-1.7851947546,-1.331387639,-0.1786190271,0.0007953898,-0.9798811674,-1.7768887281,-0.375407517,0.6777685881,0.8994427323,0.2887195945,0.9794317484,-0.4813600481,0.6141051054,-0.8720209599,1.5830682516,-1.7107974291,-0.7244264483,0.5906096101,-1.4753470421,-1.8307275772,1.1237103939,0.6991801858,-2.4696156979,-0.1385753006,0.7285892367,0.5536254048,1.0021164417,-0.7106851339,-0.1712183207,0.9622488618,0.2383135557,2.3474764824,-0.6442257762,-0.4629738331,2.4604771137,-1.2647621632,-0.8597245812,0.6158274412,0.0568563454,1.0995428562,-0.1585434973,0.0176167153,1.0341283083]},{"index":36,"text":"your

improve the lives of the american people? who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done? now, i revere my late mother, and she gave me a lot of good advice. but one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was, you know, the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down. it's whether you get back up. america's been knocked down. that great recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth disappeared. and although we've made progress, we're standing but not running the way america needs to. my mission as president will be to raise incomes for hard-working middle-class families and to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain i was raised with: if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. please join me in this campaign. please come and make it clear that america's best days are still ahead. thank you very

you didn't go out and get a cab? he said, no, i don't get cabs in washington, d.c. this was 20 years ago. because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. i couldn't believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in washington, d.c. tell you another story, i was with young people active in the black lives matter movement. a young lady comes up to me and she says, you don't understand what police do in certain black communities. you don't understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and i'm not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we've got to hold police officers accountable, i'm just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people. so to answer your question, i would say, and i think it's similar to what the secretary said, when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto. you don't know what it's like to be poor. you don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car. and i believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear. we will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system.","class":0,"tokens":[1.000844717,0.5350897312,0.1401611865,-1.1111838818,-1.0728974342,1.8620175123,1.3487110138,-0.2992029488,0.0816834122,0.1758975089,1.5009585619,-0.4192303717,0.7829464674,-0.243141368,-1.2088015079,1.5752224922,0.395983994,-1.0802594423,-0.6391112208,-0.1966757327,3.5426094532,-1.5989024639,0.4648275375,0.6082798839,-1.9357529879,0.4533106089,-0.8845360875,1.2426795959,0.7031068206,1.2727514505,-0.4301921427,1.6738677025,-1.6461356878,0.3150170445,0.5074522495,-1.1107258797,1.7098047733,0.9803850651,0.3964373767,1.0481985807,0.8842781186,0.1381655782,0.3122978508,0.2990839183,-0.8407744765,1.8224166632,1.4966042042,1.683067441,-1.1078776121,-1.163644433,-1.5076339245,2.1142859459,1.9973728657,1.8248000145,-0.1029510126]},{"index":62,"text":"john,

available not just for her, but for all of our children. i have spent a very long time -- my entire adult life -- looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her god-given potential. i've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and i've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. at the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them. and then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one. right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. so i have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair

has been a resurgence of sunni activities, as exemplified by isis. and we have to support sunni-arab and kurdish forces against isis, because i believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the united states to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what isis wants. they've advertised that. they want american troops back in the middle east. they want american soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity. so, i think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of american troops into syria and iraq to fight isis. and we do have to form a coalition. i know how hard that is. i have formed them. i put together a coalition, including arabs, with respect to libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto iran. and you have to really work hard at it. and the final thing i would say, bringing donald trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of isis you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the

let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they're related. as i've said many times before, my parents were never rich people. my father was a bartender. my mother was a maid. they worked for a living. but they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves. we call that the american dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. it is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people. what makes america special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful. the problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. if i thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, i would be all for it, but it isn't. in the 20th century, it's a disaster. if you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine. and that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated. here's the best way to raise wages. make america the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. for the life of me, i don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education. welders make more money than philosophers. we need more welders and less philosophers.","class":1,"tokens":[-3.0466535091,1.0975717306,-1.3488835096,-2.4905512333,0.9031422734,-1.5761532784,-1.6573694944,2.0472643375,-1.5166277885,-1.2234574556,-0.3764115274,-2.0345129967,0.1498037726,0.2792827487,0.934515357,0.5523276329,1.7144678831,-0.312173754,-0.884088099,0.4495334625,2.1011250019,1.2804374695,1.0341254473,1.0525163412,2.0700159073,-1.5525127649,-2.9395854473,0.7980352044,-1.2874530554,0.5525400639,0.4339408576,-0.6917051077,0.7188247442,0.2275963575,-0.2367157787,0.5908653736,2.3240423203,0.5649262667,-0.9868987203,-0.8129832149,-0.8550095558,0.3712273836,-0.7212494016,-1.0150376558,0.3315527737,0.040060699,1.2761948109,1.1558487415,2.3434464931,0.4360059798,0.0974835902,2.3157007694,-0.1750600785,1.2577483654,1.335168004]},{"index":246,"text":"what

i gotta tell you, one of the things i was most proud of when i ran for senate here in texas, i earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in texas. at the same time, mitt romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide. and, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community. the values in our community are faith, family, patriotism. you know, we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country. and, when i campaigned, and i campaigned the same here in houston or dallas as i did in the rio grande valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- christian principals, telling my father's story. telling my dad's story of coming to america with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking english, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the american dream. and, the truth is the obama-clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community. it is not working in

first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of america safe. i have a plan that i've put forward to go after isis. not to contain

network of terrorism. and thirdly, to do more to keep us safe. under each of those three parts of my plan, i have very specific recommendations about what to do. obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an american-led air campaign, we have to have arab and kurdish troops on the ground. secondly, we've got to go after everything from north africa to south asia and beyond. and then, most importantly, here at home, i think there are three things that we have to get right. we have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information. that now includes the internet, because we have seen that isis is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence. that means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies. they can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists. we've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning. and we must work more closely with muslim-american communities. just like martin, i met with a group of muslim-americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization. they will be

dictators all over the world. and god only knows saddam hussein was a brutal dictator. we could overthrow assad tomorrow if we wanted to. we got rid of gadhafi. but the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after. and in libya, for example, the united states, secretary clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi. but what happened is a political vacuum developed. isis came in, and now occupies significant territory in libya,

also remember that he spent the last day of his life in memphis, fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people. and that is our fight still. we have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone, including those who have been left out and left behind. we have to keep our communities and our country safe. we need a president who can do all aspects of the job. i understand that this is the hardest job in the world. i'm prepared and ready to take it on and i hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the democratic party and the next president of the united states.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.6281594634,0.5533468723,-1.4796376228,-1.1842399836,-0.056275975,-0.0083389888,0.6440406442,1.1114785671,-3.398481369,1.1847300529,0.1723173559,0.2346610874,-0.9052231908,-0.3201392293,0.3049116433,-0.5187754035,1.4769202471,-0.2371671498,2.356007576,0.2035839856,0.7054457664,0.227906093,-0.6897602081,-0.0239317995,1.3682026863,0.409970969,-0.7345595956,0.3076306581,-0.9083179832,-0.9960085154,0.1372027099,0.6520788074,-0.5415503979,-0.4015468657,0.4906124175,0.0508008562,0.9784522057,0.6699995399,0.2676974535,-1.4880982637,0.5533755422,1.6878175735,-0.4650569856,0.4365560114,0.4050547481,0.3317212164,1.3416947126,0.4059222639,-0.5555691123,0.0034905144,-0.2934508622,1.9318443537,2.9495384693,0.4581728578,0.0476441197]},{"index":514,"text":"you

him against george w. bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment. and i'll give one more example on israel. when the obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of israel, when hamas was raining rockets down on them, i publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against israel? the next day michael bloomberg, another new york billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to israel from london. together the heat and light that was put on the state department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into israel. during that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on israel the natural question is, where was donald? if this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-israel politicians from jimmy carter to hillary clinton to john kerry for four decades? if you care about israel, you don't write checks to politicians who are undermining israel. instead you stand and support the national security of america and the alliance with israel.","class":1,"tokens":[2.2660079002,-1.9852256775,-0.0751455277,-0.099644348,0.353957206,1.5218406916,0.2009930909,0.794002831,-1.2848953009,0.2303298265,-0.4006560445,1.5887027979,-1.6875948906,1.0578112602,0.5706877112,0.6966522932,-1.9218364954,-1.0783265829,1.3545978069,-2.1328647137,0.6771637797,0.7458009124,2.2274403572,-2.2830018997,0.6566067934,1.8109425306,2.0114004612,-0.6873418093,1.9604238272,-0.0681541786,-1.7747380733,-1.7485121489,-1.9774749279,0.5199091434,-0.6159697175,-0.6298000216,0.4294290543,1.0276315212,0.7551447749,-3.9809477329,-0.4483015239,3.1698591709,-1.4424567223,-0.4505784214,1.3785126209,0.0776543692,-0.4922423363,1.9900237322,-0.6738408208,1.5612633228,-1.7059795856,0.5833112597,1.5020674467,0.0401473679,-1.1044614315]},{"index":515,"text":"john,

charged by their own government. 7 percent and 8 percent to go to college? i mean, my dad went to college on a g.i. bill after coming home from japan, flying 33 missions. my daughters went to college on a mountain of bills. we were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives. it -- it doesn't need to be that way. we can have debt-free college in the united states.","class":0,"tokens":[-2.7039730549,0.959961772,-0.5790899992,-0.7506253719,0.9356345534,1.0772418976,-1.5077701807,0.0451311953,-0.7465397716,0.4679584205,-1.4144917727,-2.4529213905,0.540822804,-0.5246583819,1.031206727,0.3021465242,0.4653249383,-0.6296066046,1.6911151409,0.9247483611,-1.5438030958,-0.4122421741,-0.7623252869,-0.3939571679,0.7808062434,-2.2966742516,-0.5838366151,0.5821189284,-0.3238975704,-0.3333525956,0.457680136,0.2637491822,-0.5143216848,-1.7126134634,-2.7966053486,0.4880747795,0.1853984594,1.7319681644,-0.1325072348,2.1084370613,0.0029125286,1.7024326324,2.3200871944,-1.0613428354,-1.7441595793,1.263540864,-0.0495673977,0.5346414447,-0.0162691679,-0.8175064921,-1.0371888876,1.9747442007,0.0645742342,-0.3650900126,-0.9393705726]},{"index":688,"text":"and

entire life, starting from clerking for chief justice william rehnquist on the united states supreme court, one of the most principled jurists. we have an out-of-control court, and i give you my word, if i'm elected president, every single supreme court justice will faithfully follow the law and will not act like philosopher kings

of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives, and to hear dr. king speak in chicago when i was about 14 years old. that got me thinking about what i needed to do to try to fulfill my faith. when i was in law school, i had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman, named mary right adelman, who worked with dr. king who was the first african-american woman who passed the mississippi bar. i asked her for a job and she said she didn't have any money. i was working my way through law school and she said if i could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. so i got law students a civil rights research council grant. the first thing she did was send me to look at south carolina, to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails. the second thing she did was to send me to alabama to investigate segregated academies. so from that moment until today, i am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the

easy to talk about the problems. but do you have a solution to fix it? and i think the solution is several things. number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting american workers first, not the corporate board room. number two, we need to lift the regulations on american businesses here so we see jobs coming back. and number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan i've introduced

country. and if this will go -- this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on. we will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in america and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition. we don't want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, dana. so that's really what we're doing. this is not a theory. this is what we are actually doing in our state. we will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives. if our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what? they will get a financial reward. our primary care physicians need help. they need support. we're losing them. this will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.","class":1,"tokens":[0.238280654,1.9254684448,-0.5787995458,-1.8695751429,1.2811700106,2.2065010071,0.2816937566,0.5296697617,-1.3471758366,-3.1381552219,1.250494957,-4.4561915398,-1.2617282867,0.7339098454,-1.6034394503,-0.0611409433,1.8590884209,0.9263728261,-1.1262402534,0.5351692438,-2.5430910587,1.025318861,0.1985720694,-0.7580460906,2.0608093739,-1.0014791489,1.0666213036,4.7963137627,-0.8661927581,0.7538568974,-0.8810248971,-0.0354859978,0.3252579272,-0.2448808551,1.3593901396,-0.164436087,2.6879098415,0.1170280501,-0.1121549606,-0.7849454284,-0.5499261618,0.9721958637,-0.4880212247,1.6780331135,-1.9620070457,-0.9988542199,1.0475445986,1.8786075115,1.6467826366,-0.2247554064,-2.4364752769,0.5415222645,-1.0549502373,0.4363202453,-0.8632515669]},{"index":943,"text":"well,

you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. but let me just say this. in terms of where we are right now, as you mention, rachel, in a number of national and state, including new hampshire. for example, the last poll i saw -- there may have been a new one -- last one i saw here in new hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. there were also pretty large margins in iowa and wisconsin. these are polls. polls go up. polls go down. but here's why i think i will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process. republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. i believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout. if there is a large voter turnout,

their care-taking responsibilities. and the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their social security monthly payment. so

federal reserve has made this problem worse. by artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money. they're actually talking now about negative interest. the money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in new york. and because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. so what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality. we also find that as the federal reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst. so really we need to reexamine whether we not -- we want a federal reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates. we also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse. but the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a city with a republican mayor or a state with a republican governor.","class":1,"tokens":[-1.7531495094,0.1969058365,-0.4670934379,2.2326614857,-0.7296290994,0.14013955,-0.2699036598,0.0039511733,-0.6500270367,-3.2779381275,0.0171011779,-1.738802433,2.6827697754,-0.2158198208,0.9979772568,-0.4258409441,-1.6322445869,1.5043427944,0.3508139849,1.3624500036,-0.6471330523,2.1977784634,-0.1977977455,0.3699399531,0.3694012165,-2.4503347874,-0.3652872443,-0.9835100174,1.3488397598,-0.0308796763,-0.5653553605,0.8943449855,1.9465827942,0.0620211959,-1.237418294,0.9701608419,0.423386544,-0.4337622523,-1.6240820885,2.1402595043,0.4784202874,-1.6675527096,-1.5778355598,0.2068907171,-2.1390769482,0.8974983096,1.4697755575,3.0314483643,0.3812564909,-0.3392049372,-1.4259361029,1.9036345482,-1.1549153328,0.0344037525,-1.1060436964]},{"index":1051,"text":"who

strengthened the tools of national security and law enforcement to go after terrorists. it gave us greater tools and we are seeing those tools work right now in san bernardino. and in particular, what it did is the prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. when you had a terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily land lines. the usa freedom act expands that so now we have cell phones, now we have internet phones, now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys. you know what the obama administration keeps getting wrong is whenever anything bad happens they focus on law-abiding citizens instead of focusing on the bad guys. we need to focus on radical

this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning. i haven't changed anything with it. and, look, my view is, we need economic growth. everything starts with economic growth. and how do you get it? common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget. that gives you economic growth. i did it when i was in washington, as the budget committee chairman, negotiating actually with democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in ohio. but here's the thing that i believe. economic growth is not an end unto itself. we have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise. of course, our friends in the hispanic community, our friends in the african-american community, the promise of america is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone. it's what jack kemp used to say. a rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats. and you know what? with me and the hispanic community, i think they like me. and i appreciate that, because i want them to have the same opportunity that i and my children and my

problems.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.105186604,1.0877251625,-1.5974826813,-0.9203252196,-0.5243038535,0.2031049281,-1.6081582308,0.6830573678,-0.124126181,0.3136084974,0.5179730058,-4.3809905052,-0.5147311091,-0.5782787204,-1.3804175854,-0.3371238708,-1.2768312693,0.7139869332,1.181566596,-0.5663881898,0.2560533583,1.9050476551,0.1897102296,-0.7717607617,0.1369498223,-2.1869671345,-0.3034607172,-1.1106387377,-0.1566895097,0.2919034362,-0.683450222,0.3750849962,-0.4455530643,-0.3030284941,-1.2153333426,-1.463562727,0.5036445856,0.4848834574,0.1375642866,0.5655064583,-0.1120516434,0.2290278524,1.3944532871,-1.1051360369,0.7706952691,1.202103138,1.9728405476,-0.0997590944,0.589390099,0.9255017638,1.2781291008,-0.4397552907,1.9608895779,1.8563277721,0.9767243862]},{"index":1319,"text":"we

the chinese as well. and we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and i think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have

not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills. when my parents came, they had a very limited education. my father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died

know, i think we need to set the record straight on this, because i think marco misspoke about the bill. on the gang of eight bill, there was no provisions really for extra scrutiny or safety for refugees. at the time the bill came up, two iraqi refugees came to my home town, bowling green, kentucky. their fingerprints were on a bomb from iraq. they were in the database, but we didn't pick them up. we relocated them here, put them in government housing, got them on food stamps. and we began providing for them, but we didn't have adequate security. on the gang of eight bill, on marco's bill, we had an opportunity. there was a conservative consensus for an amendment i put forward called trust, but verify that would have strengthened border security on both refugees, students and those coming here. and marco sided and i guess was more sympathetic to chuck schumer and to the president than he was to conservative principles. but this goes directly to national defense. and if he wants to run as a national -- national defense conservative, he's got to explain why he hasn't stepped up to support border

i have what i call the new college compact. because i think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know. number one, states have been dis-investing in higher education. in fact, i think new hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country. so states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education. so under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system. secondly, i don't believe in free tuition for everybody. i believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead. so i have proposed debt free tuition, which i think is affordable and i would move a lot of the pell grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense. so i put all of this together, again, on my website and i've gotten such a good response. but i want to quickly say, one of the areas that senator sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems. free college, a single payer system for health--and it's been estimated we're looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget. and i have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to

trying to move the boundaries of the post-world war ii europe. the way that he is trying to set european countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in crimea. beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the baltics. we know that they are deeply engaged in supporting assad because they want to have a place in the middle east. they have a naval base, they have an air base in syria. they want to hang on to that. i think what secretary carter is seeing, and i'm glad he is, is that we got to get nato back working for the common defense. we've got to do more to

that. we know what it takes to do that. it takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. it takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. it takes a mandatory e-verify system and a mandatory entry\/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. after we have done that, the second thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal immigration system. and after we have done those two things, i think the american people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn't otherwise violated our laws -- because if they're a criminal they can't stay. they'll have to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. and ultimately, they'll given a work permit and that's all they're gonna be allowed to have for at

had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, i recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of gadhafi. i think that what libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path. now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the arab spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that isis and other terrorist groups do. but what we're seeing happening in libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among libyans themselves to try to dislodge

heard this horrible story. it was a headline in usa today, and it said, \"calls to the v.a. suicide hotline went to voicemail.\" well, about a few days ago, we now found out that one of the gentlemen -- one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide. and they happened to call him back the day after he died. people need to be held accountable for this. one of the things i'm proudest of is that in my time in the u.s. senate working with jeff miller here from florida in a bipartisan way, and i'll give him credit -- bernie sanders was a part of this -- we passed a v.a. accountability bill. and what it did is it created now a law that gives the v.a. secretary, because of the law i passed, it gives the v.a. secretary the power to fire people that aren't doing a good job. senior executives should be held accountable if the v.a. outreach isn't working. the problem is no one's being held accountable. even after we passed that law, no one's been fired for no outreach. no one's been fired for calls going to the voicemail. no one's been disciplined. no one's been demoted. when i'm president of the united states, if you work at the v.a. and you are not doing a good job, you

with respect to syria, i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made. the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria. the agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to. you know, the russians wanted to buy time. are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. but i would add this. you know, the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution. at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together. this is incredibly complicated, because we've got iran as a big player, in addition to russia. we have saudi arabia, turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. this is one of the areas i've disagreed with senator sanders on, who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria, which i think would be a grave mistake. putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me. trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. so let's support what secretary kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. and remember, the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups. so as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and the like. so we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the russians.","class":0,"tokens":[3.3866386414,-0.9731798768,1.8050479889,4.8909983635,-2.1633849144,-1.1429805756,1.8419113159,1.936147809,-1.0217903852,0.4824914336,0.2188042104,-0.2249615341,-1.2993575335,-1.6317383051,0.4639582336,-1.6282944679,-0.1910081953,1.0293366909,2.8786036968,2.8810768127,-0.2370603532,0.3829625249,-1.64445436,0.3197076619,1.2386535406,2.0484890938,-0.0453345999,-1.9375607967,-2.2344293594,-1.9188700914,-2.7015049458,-0.420260787,-1.9049772024,0.9539968371,-0.4939545393,-0.2046522945,1.4527767897,-0.6802223921,-0.2639569044,1.854604125,-1.6175346375,-0.1437237263,0.0491962172,-0.0201205872,0.9974492788,1.0108908415,2.5273582935,1.3095948696,0.2517285943,1.3375105858,1.874581933,2.7678637505,0.8750017881,-3.4616355896,-0.5543715358]},{"index":1882,"text":"everybody

i'm glad you asked that, maria. here's -- here's our plan. we've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform. if you reform the corporate

that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. and who can blame them? they pay tax once overseas. they don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back. so beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money. bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the united states. we'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. and i would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country. it would not necessitate us raising any taxes. it would bring the money back into the united states to help build jobs by american companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and

in this country. we'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively. and remember this -- i'm credible on this for this reason: americans for tax reform says that i've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in american history. we don't need to raise taxes to get this done. we need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the united states to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need
