there to let the chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more. and in the trade agreement, the tpp, it's critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the chinese. they are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend. and finally, i will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics. when the fall comes, and we run against hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected. i have two 16-year-old girls, and i want this country to be strong. we make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble. we must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid. i served in washington as the chairman of the budget committee, and we got the budget balanced. and in ohio, as the ceo, and guess what, we have got to have a ceo mentality and a way to beat hillary clinton and the democracies in the fall. and our ideas have to add up. they have to be solid. and people have to know we have the confidence to lead america. and as president, i will lead this country, as i have before in washington and in ohio, and will return both on domestic and international affairs. and i appreciate the opportunity to speak this time, gerry.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.2900249958,2.6816635132,-0.2148746699,-0.1126041561,-0.9840043783,0.4773260057,-0.8605946898,-0.0896998569,0.6606413126,-0.8590127826,-1.0874245167,-0.2690479755,-1.7245904207,0.7700328827,0.4008329511,1.7186529636,0.066140078,0.3425478637,0.6620227098,-1.273517251,1.4927538633,-2.2706882954,-0.4182525873,-0.2069316506,1.5709449053,1.3026503325,1.0303685665,-0.6498664021,-0.4627154469,0.5953248739,0.1178681627,2.6577746868,-1.7013142109,1.0467429161,0.661849618,-2.9039268494,-0.5359252095,1.1860635281,0.5490469933,1.1144247055,0.6528944969,3.957934618,1.1494711637,-3.751190424,-2.3646430969,-1.2453165054,0.5261830091,-0.5083851814,-0.0496778674,0.6244961619,-0.1228852421,-0.8151999712,1.2168431282,0.5827302933,-0.6493803859,-1.5117629766,1.0389822721,-1.6428961754,1.4314655066,-1.6134344339]},{"index":57,"text":"let

unfortunately. they set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum. not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. and we also want parental advisers in the

century and what we need to do with our kids? we need to start connecting them to the real world. we need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st century, not the jobs of 20 years ago. we need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their k through 12 they ought to be connected with

makes us less safe. this is real the debate we have to have in the middle east. every time we have toppled a secular dictator, we have gotten chaos, the rise of radical islam, and we're more at risk. so, i think we need to think before we act, and know most interventions, if not a lot of them in the middle east, have actually backfired on us.","class":1,"tokens":[1.1080533266,1.6073783636,-1.901563406,0.2496453226,-0.9822686315,1.0186759233,0.1100136116,-1.9380178452,0.7385014892,0.8980564475,-0.9115098715,-0.9732600451,0.4759852886,-1.6225913763,1.0364648104,1.520660162,-1.0731050968,1.5094588995,2.3080546856,0.3017127514,2.611941576,1.1097320318,0.3903136849,-1.0976433754,-0.3253999054,-1.2311133146,0.6546754837,1.1529370546,0.9353852272,1.3733431101,0.9944352508,1.3794499636,1.2371308804,0.7316325307,0.4348628223,0.0580411516,-0.3342577219,0.7626959085,-0.0071559241,0.4461132288,1.6207150221,0.5452544093,1.3592032194,-0.5917314291,-0.6323009133,0.847977221,-1.0606837273,-0.8103533983,-1.3963493109,1.110860467,-0.020166358,-0.2488278002,0.9010038972,0.8140990138,-1.1296699047,0.1511650234,-0.8893414736,0.889842093,-0.3652859032,-0.9719885588]},{"index":304,"text":"well,

run by democrats and countries currently run by democrats. so the thing is, let's look for root causes. but i would also say -- lay some blame at the -- the feet of the federal reserve. i think the federal reserve has made this problem worse. by artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money. they're actually talking now about negative interest. the money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in new york. and because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. so what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality. we also find that as the federal reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst. so really we need to reexamine whether we not -- we want a federal reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates. we also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse. but the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a city with a republican mayor or a state with a republican governor.","class":1,"tokens":[0.2566984594,0.2512761056,-0.9712417126,1.7500075102,1.7069867849,1.2775152922,0.2863963842,-2.0154695511,1.2197593451,1.0790922642,-1.9228937626,-3.7160170078,1.0017590523,0.8835940361,0.4511198401,-0.8370894194,-0.8475440741,-1.2783948183,-1.1526520252,-0.1226015612,0.0238586944,-1.4739551544,-0.0044609066,-0.2462766767,1.2851092815,-1.3623604774,1.0229344368,2.7076175213,0.3434571624,-0.2524445951,0.0624644682,-0.1011453569,-0.8810918927,0.9071384668,-0.350636214,0.4144071639,1.6539422274,1.5278836489,-0.8062759638,1.5615555048,0.0752286091,1.4336949587,-1.0755341053,0.8199044466,-1.2707502842,0.7890857458,1.6708712578,-1.6354162693,-0.1728482991,1.0076743364,-2.778290987,-0.7009230256,-1.8711314201,-2.3674376011,-3.1377379894,1.8382287025,1.9973766804,0.791480422,-0.9376884699,0.0649302751]},{"index":370,"text":"thank

sector.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.2813980877,-0.397241056,0.8116132617,-0.3206329346,0.8595066667,0.732426703,0.0449364074,-0.2905741036,-0.1997952312,-1.0983785391,0.8085442781,-1.0197609663,-0.9892885089,-0.0794319361,1.2943398952,-0.2095120251,-1.1052687168,-0.1429121196,0.3512624204,-0.1199386939,0.2284034044,-1.0502610207,0.6738069654,0.5358523726,0.2250696868,1.1811922789,0.24470824,0.5282191634,0.2213837057,-0.5233632326,0.1355497837,1.8422379494,-1.2967988253,0.9696319699,-0.2670238316,-0.2281829119,0.0032713835,1.411016345,0.4285186827,-0.6557032466,-1.1910027266,-0.5371162891,1.4583073854,0.1415603608,-0.189528212,0.2267720997,-0.3457026482,0.2672487497,0.3273698092,-0.0694044381,0.064442277,-0.7532793283,-2.2387726307,0.519718647,-0.3857759237,1.1280186176,1.0389657021,1.6322516203,-0.7308793664,0.6412250996]},{"index":401,"text":"...on

first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop gadhafi from committing massacres against his people. the united states was asked to support the europeans and the arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, i recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of gadhafi. i think that what libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path. now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the arab spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that isis and other terrorist groups do. but what we're seeing happening in libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among libyans themselves to try to dislodge isis from sirte, the home town of gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government. you know, this is not easy work. we did a lot to help. we did as much as we could because the libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept. but we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.","class":0,"tokens":[3.931940794,0.2554848194,-0.6670321822,1.3230544329,-0.6304581165,-2.1730368137,-0.1669694036,0.4165507555,-0.6818924546,1.2445642948,1.0093954802,-1.6737964153,-1.9712860584,-0.4804777205,-0.8524726629,1.7987433672,-2.488692522,1.266479969,-0.2096597254,-1.366772294,1.4296114445,-0.0996706858,-2.4508795738,-0.601391077,-0.0319525339,-0.1640934497,2.3621683121,1.3386780024,-1.3607140779,1.6435222626,0.5635751486,-0.5404561758,0.2487839013,-0.3201763034,1.3563500643,1.6080726385,-0.3465863168,-0.9399866462,0.4205146134,1.6794496775,2.4315941334,1.0326960087,0.8921797276,-0.8699943423,0.7510005236,-0.3597343862,0.148757413,0.1180339679,-1.0319100618,0.0230820216,0.358574301,0.6273599267,-0.1235646084,0.6601012349,-0.1877765805,-1.0279434919,0.1425000727,-0.507933557,0.5250731707,-0.6166852117]},{"index":434,"text":"now,

the community. and imagine america without its community banks. well, that's what's happening because of dodd-frank. that's -- that's my worry. my worry is that the real economy has been hurt by the vast overreach of the obama administration. and hillary clinton, she wants to double down on that. she wants to create even more so. she is a captive of the left of her party to the point now where she is -- she was for the trade agreement in -- the pacific agreement. now she's against it. she was -- hinted she was for the xl pipeline. now she's opposed to it. all the things that would create sustained economic growth she's now doubling down against

is it did two things. number one, it ended the federal government's bulk collection of phone metadata of millions of law-abiding citizens. but number two in the second half of it that is critical. it strengthened the tools of national security and law enforcement to go after terrorists. it gave us greater tools and we are seeing those tools work right now in san bernardino. and in particular, what it did is the prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. when you had a terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily land lines. the usa freedom act expands that so now we have cell phones, now we have internet phones, now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys. you know what the obama administration keeps getting wrong is whenever anything bad happens they focus on law-abiding citizens instead of focusing on the bad guys. we need to focus on radical islamic terrorists and we need to stop them before they carry out acts of terror.","class":1,"tokens":[0.356302619,1.3821275234,-1.6839318275,1.1221901178,-1.1792211533,-2.1357088089,-0.3023992181,-1.0626339912,-2.770485878,-0.1042204872,2.7503025532,-0.4437091053,-0.8886469007,-0.9272298217,0.8628970981,0.3006848097,-0.9997654557,0.3231724799,1.1529250145,0.5752316117,-1.2016216516,-2.1599907875,0.9649595022,1.4005303383,-0.2109208554,-3.2131438255,0.7301734686,0.7743526697,-1.9724664688,0.2383206338,-2.1832883358,0.691242516,0.7194277644,-0.5947360396,-1.4719685316,-0.0106020514,-1.9874141216,-1.177738905,0.3217244744,2.3193221092,0.3791536689,0.4463398159,1.6156666279,1.7344024181,0.3516602516,-0.1190396473,-0.8554269671,-0.660772264,-0.984847188,0.0991768464,0.2650732696,-1.8683178425,1.0460591316,1.8000462055,0.8562198877,-0.5822864771,0.2647021711,-0.4033624828,0.8024788499,-0.652361095]},{"index":571,"text":"and,

has been a resurgence of sunni activities, as exemplified by isis. and we have to support sunni-arab and kurdish forces against isis, because i believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the united states to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what isis wants. they've advertised that. they want american troops back in the middle east. they want american soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity. so, i think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of american troops into syria and iraq to fight isis. and we do have to form a coalition. i know how hard that is. i have formed them. i put together a coalition, including arabs, with respect to libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto iran. and you have to really work hard at it. and the final thing i would say, bringing

i look at our economy as an ecosystem. and the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow. and most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that. but there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage. we're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace american capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of wall street-directed crony capitalism. and for my part, i have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on wall street in ways that secretary clinton never, ever has. in fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with wall street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9\/11. i believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition. there's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages. and the worst type of concentration, secretary clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot. and that's why today you still cannot support, as i do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we

secretary of state. i'm the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child. and every day, i think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her, but for all of our children. i have spent a very long time -- my entire adult life -- looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her god-given potential. i've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and i've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. at the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them. and then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one. right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. so i have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families. and i want to do more to help us balance family and work. i believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but i also believe it's about time we had paid family leave for american families and join the rest of the world.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.8789356351,-0.4889687896,-0.024557298,-1.0412518978,1.2486320734,1.1832798719,-0.8366249204,0.2032064795,0.4840654731,1.6265918016,0.3728795648,-2.3500945568,-2.2394797802,0.7033256888,0.7169350982,1.6323268414,-1.7272188663,0.7339946032,-1.2344719172,-1.1576089859,-1.2159216404,-0.9201812148,1.9234867096,0.4163651466,-0.4335471988,1.3717499971,-0.3125212491,1.1703506708,-0.7666108608,1.3357343674,-0.7597090602,-0.3040272593,-1.5308523178,-2.1433942318,0.8867535591,-0.4072422683,-1.0015841722,1.0637910366,1.1153848171,-0.3189509809,0.5502256751,0.9151234031,0.6722353101,0.1095630303,-0.7546957731,2.5343387127,-0.0257643908,-0.5223499537,0.0605129302,-1.991595149,-1.5906208754,-1.2820501328,-2.7376334667,0.5659630299,0.0754353479,-0.7146889567,0.0502923578,1.7003353834,0.3656678796,2.53753829]},{"index":667,"text":"probably

save and redeem lives, and to do more of them, and to stop doing the things that don't. for my part, that's what i have done in 15 years of experience as a mayor and as a governor. we restored voting

lethal force and brutality complaints. this is something that -- and i put forward a new agenda for criminal justice reform that is informed by that experience. so as president, i would lead these

energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes. and we can do

who either have gone through or are experiencing difficult times, illness, divorce, death, disappointment, all of the life experiences that confront most of us. i pray for the will of god to be known that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability, try to follow it and fulfill it. i have said many times that, you know, i am a praying person, and if i haven't been during the time i was in the white house, i would have become one. because it's very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith. so i do pray for people in authority. i try to think about what they are going through, even when i disagree with them. trying to find some common ground, some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic. i don't always succeed. i will tell you that. so i pray on a pretty regular basis during the day, because i need that strength and i need that support. and especially when you are in the position that i'm in and that senator sanders is in, where you are asking people to vote for you, to give you the most important job, not only in our country, but i would argue in the world. i think humility is one

me -- let me just say this. what a president of the united states has got to do and what is his or her major, i think, responsibility is to, a, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values, that we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity. i voted against the war in iraq because i listened very carefully to what president bush and vice president cheney had to say and i didn't believe them. and if you go to my web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what i feared would happen when i spoke on the floor of the house, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. now i think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where secretary clinton and i disagree is the area of regime change. look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the united states, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. and god only knows saddam hussein was a brutal dictator. we could overthrow assad tomorrow if we wanted to. we got rid of gadhafi. but the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after. and in libya, for example, the united states, secretary clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi. but what happened is a political vacuum developed. isis came in, and now occupies significant territory in libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. but this is nothing new. this has gone on 50 or 60 years where the united states has been involved in overthrowing governments. mossadegh back in 1953. nobody knows who mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of iran. he was overthrown by british and american interests because he threatened oil interests of the british. and as a result of that, the shah of iran came in, terrible dictator. the result of that, you had the iranian revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. unintended consequences. so i believe as president i will look very carefully about unintended consequences. i will do everything i can to make certain that the united states and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the middle east.","class":0,"tokens":[3.1210131645,1.4836087227,1.5275527239,0.1096104011,-1.0930736065,-0.3261731565,0.4097358584,-0.7763509154,0.0555828288,-0.2142614871,-0.2435957044,-0.2040453702,0.2910908461,0.4001132846,-0.966699779,0.2460338473,0.8643084168,1.0220382214,0.0272663124,-1.4359595776,0.5452957153,0.9071572423,-0.9826290607,-1.015131712,-1.583827734,-2.1247329712,-0.6741746068,0.452973038,-1.1300529242,-1.4628148079,3.4464590549,1.1604868174,1.4362541437,0.2144732028,0.554831326,2.332899332,0.281239301,-0.8161121607,-0.205984816,2.7588927746,-0.1156297475,2.4280388355,0.6257871985,-1.6262388229,0.9488403201,-0.1846693009,-1.6982729435,-0.2671560943,0.1367913038,-0.5498744249,1.2810378075,-0.6523625851,0.0729197338,0.6438590288,1.139883399,0.3246670663,-1.481693387,0.6941077113,1.2378143072,0.2725165486]},{"index":946,"text":"he

of law enforcement officers. here's what we need to do, and i think this is where donald is absolutely right. what we need to do is to secure our border, and we need to do it with more than just a wall. we need to use electronics, we need to use drones, we need to use fbi, dea, and atf, and yes, we need to take the fingerprint of every person who comes into this country on a visa, and when they overstay their visa, we need to tap them on the shoulder, and say, \"you have overstayed your welcome, you're taking advantage of the american people. it's time for you to go.\" if we had that kind of system in place, we wouldn't have the 11 million people we have now.","class":1,"tokens":[1.0470961332,0.0659957305,0.178023845,-0.0504865311,0.1885726005,1.8050918579,-0.3168706894,-0.4671975076,-0.2562017143,-0.3069264293,-0.6335629821,-0.4969935119,0.1883923262,-1.0203210115,1.1218260527,0.7510350347,-1.6097911596,0.2841201723,0.9218558669,1.2757598162,0.2339912057,-1.5155533552,-0.4414457381,1.3571516275,-0.1786794662,0.7985458374,0.0737600401,0.4542976618,-0.4881851375,0.2079525739,-0.713847816,-0.8518981338,0.600661397,-0.7604565024,-1.731485486,1.4338129759,1.8357528448,-0.105787456,-0.9604097009,0.3636983931,-2.0009284019,0.3556317091,0.4657221735,1.4698828459,-0.1731365025,0.5157346725,-0.9385221004,0.5278201103,0.0455156788,-0.2879071832,0.7190805078,-1.1806343794,0.99683851,-0.3828793764,-0.0317996629,-0.1426374018,0.4916315079,-0.062458314,-1.2231996059,0.1242705733]},{"index":1034,"text":"when

a plan in 1999 to save social security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have social security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts. now there are more

raising the retirement age. if you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on social security, you'll still get it. it will just simply be less. and for those people who depend on that social security, they'll get their full benefit. that's the way it will work. and we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age. and how do i know that? i've done all this

i have what i call the new college compact. because i think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know. number one, states have been dis-investing in higher education. in fact, i think new hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country. so states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education. so under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system. secondly, i don't believe in free tuition for everybody. i believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead. so i have proposed debt free tuition, which i think is affordable and i would move a lot of the pell grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense. so i put all of this together, again, on my website and i've gotten such a good response. but i want to quickly say, one of the areas that senator sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems. free college, a single payer system for health--and it's been estimated we're looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget. and i have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to

him against george w. bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment. and i'll give one more example on israel. when the obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of israel, when hamas was raining rockets down on them, i publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against israel? the next day michael bloomberg, another new york billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to israel from london. together the heat and light that was put on the state department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into israel.

hugh, i agree with you that it -- justice scalia's passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election. justice scalia was someone i knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend. and with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance. we are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the second amendment right to keep and bear arms from the constitution. now, i think the voters of texas, the voters across super tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this -- this stage. in the past, republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists. so i'm certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that. but the reality is, democrats bat about 1,000. just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want. republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster. i've spent my whole life fighting to defend the bill of rights and the constitution. i can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the second amendment, they're asking the question: who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court? i give you my word, every justice i nominate will vigorously defend the bill of rights for my children and for yours.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.3162959814,0.7712506652,2.0667586327,-0.5880426168,0.8915219903,-0.7307884693,-1.8848788738,0.4856849909,1.5164260864,2.5100910664,2.2263865471,-0.4182749689,-1.1140663624,1.2052817345,0.7207298279,0.0095482636,-1.7846646309,0.4952803254,3.3013646603,-0.191984877,-2.1027057171,-1.8492101431,-1.1998980045,0.5500667095,-1.8744066954,0.0063709114,0.601757288,-0.402644664,0.8857327104,1.1181219816,0.7031606436,0.727150321,-0.1591042131,0.761814177,-0.4585102201,0.9567465186,-1.8988733292,-0.0206875093,-3.22798419,2.4129626751,-0.4603727162,-0.8428056836,0.6683122516,-0.1618930995,-0.1656742841,-0.7399540544,-0.3342372775,-1.0153934956,-0.4570174217,0.117922917,0.8507586122,0.2818840146,-0.3525874913,-0.2407712042,1.7527556419,-1.5080243349,1.1266362667,0.6757315993,-1.5239833593,-0.1741825789]},{"index":1115,"text":"let

immigrants. all of my neighbors are immigrants. i see every aspect of this problem. the good, the bad, and the ugly. and here's what we learned in 2013. the american people don't trust the federal government to enforce our immigration laws, and we will not be able to do anything on immigration until we first prove to the american people that illegal immigration is under control. and we can do that. we know what it takes to do that. it takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. it takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. it takes a mandatory e-verify system and a mandatory entry\/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. after we have done that, the second thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal immigration system. and after we have done those two things, i think the american people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn't otherwise violated our laws -- because if they're a criminal they can't stay. they'll have to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. and ultimately, they'll given a work permit and that's all they're gonna be allowed to have for at least 10 years. but you can't get to that third step until you have done the other two things, and that was the lesson we learned in 2013. there is no trust that the federal government will enforce the law. they will not support you until you see it done first.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.1395890564,-0.3734564185,0.5025965571,-0.9252027869,0.1494641304,-0.6154465675,0.4624389112,-0.8020230532,1.0094591379,0.3849731088,0.0837427974,-1.5927366018,-0.0677816197,-1.707857132,2.2164521217,-0.7490394115,0.3591920137,-0.4277189672,0.3262141645,1.6805281639,-0.7790245414,-2.4984288216,0.8036540747,2.0193459988,-2.6158714294,-0.4626294374,0.6309483647,-0.2793046832,-0.7066817284,1.2647378445,-0.3362908363,0.4164621234,1.1383852959,-1.4645113945,0.065660499,1.9424659014,-1.8079371452,-0.7069231272,-1.118252039,0.5240989923,-1.2741119862,-0.6062676311,-1.3503267765,1.5924941301,1.9543190002,0.2325551659,-1.7169597149,0.6333581209,-0.681528151,0.2175785303,-1.2071558237,-2.2488455772,-0.9551000595,0.7018267512,-0.0794835016,-1.6982676983,1.7574257851,-3.2215604782,0.2349101156,-0.5079891682]},{"index":1123,"text":"well,

arrested. it means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.2916459441,0.1879863739,-0.6905821562,0.4791199565,-0.7178173065,0.6156629324,0.6352593899,-2.0893347263,0.0032848206,2.1823079586,1.005559206,-0.6506215334,-0.295014739,0.1994226575,0.3563839793,0.8430964351,-0.0423141792,1.0626136065,-0.6083228588,0.304884702,-1.2868798971,-1.491461277,2.0042128563,-0.0486117303,-0.384948194,-0.7086277604,0.8653788567,0.178772077,-0.7859851718,-0.1020252332,-1.0560696125,-0.2138253152,0.6252636909,-0.3438738585,0.7830263972,1.5863405466,0.1363623738,0.7851456404,-1.645583272,0.0753494427,-0.2557485998,-0.2936106324,1.1178587675,-0.2637419999,-1.5807868242,0.7195795774,-0.7405203581,0.8497768044,-0.5439018607,-0.0555804931,-0.8889044523,-1.4863567352,-0.4547053277,-0.7443588376,1.0280139446,-1.2380459309,0.8621619344,1.4496934414,0.0615156107,1.660962224]},{"index":1130,"text":"one

defeating him by one. there were also pretty large margins in iowa and wisconsin. these are polls. polls go up. polls go down. but here's why i think i will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate.

not only do we retain the white house, but i think we regain the senate. we win governors' chairs up and down the line. so i believe if you want to retain the white house, if you want to see democrats

wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of state. but what i want people to know is i went to wall street before the crash. i was the one saying you're going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. i called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. i proposed changes in ceo compensation. i called for a

trying to beat me in this primary. they have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. hedge fund billionaires, karl rove, another billionaire, jumped in. and why are they doing that?

i support free trade deals that are good for america. we're 5 percent of the world's population. if all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. we have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things. the problem is we're a low-tariff country. to import something into the united states is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. and so i am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that america can sell things to all these people around the world. there are good trade deals and there are bad ones. so for example, here in florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with colombia. it's allowed flower exporters to come into the united states but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. we have a surplus with colombia. on the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. bottom line is i believe that america, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. if it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st

second great depression. and that's what he's done. our country's doing better, we're creating jobs again. but in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that we've heard coming off of the republican presidential podiums are pretty loud. we need new leadership. we need to come together as a people and build on the good things that president obama has done. that's why i'm running for president. i need your help, i ask for your vote, and i look forward to moving our country forward once again. thank you.","class":0,"tokens":[-1.5717526674,-0.6379402876,0.540240705,-0.5058833957,0.8710026741,0.1533106714,0.6366617084,-0.6625804305,0.28047207,0.2954871356,1.6036009789,-0.0358819142,0.6566260457,-0.8705158234,1.4486503601,0.790391922,-1.4639223814,-0.1426922083,0.789806962,0.4857587516,-0.5826265812,-1.2883759737,-0.83251369,1.1138521433,-0.2979267538,0.5146669149,-0.9956352711,-0.6784615517,-1.4902291298,-0.307246834,1.2159303427,0.8703451753,-0.8026323915,-1.2617343664,1.2487971783,2.0163397789,-0.211030215,-2.2113161087,0.2718316615,0.3477404118,-0.2798418701,1.2648057938,0.533330977,-1.8451786041,-2.2936675549,2.3663139343,-0.270996958,-0.1369590461,0.2170670033,-0.5115496516,-0.4427032471,0.2064045221,-1.2545543909,0.9685097933,-0.5923671722,0.0652732551,0.6104278564,0.2788212895,-0.139366433,1.9803184271]},{"index":1417,"text":"well,

first of all, healthcare is not a right. but i do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that. we spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do. i propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats. and we give it to everybody from birth until death. they can pass it on when they die. we pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. we give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. so dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle. and it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. it gives you enormous flexibility. and also, you know, if uncle joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody's going to hide his cigarettes because they're all interested in what's going on there. also, the

people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now? medicaid. what's the medicaid budget? almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a

you very much, anderson. and thanks to all the viewers who tuned in tonight. i think what you did see is that, in this debate, we tried to deal with some of the very tough issues facing our country.

improve the lives of the american people? who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done? now, i revere my late mother, and she gave me a lot of good advice. but one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was, you know, the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down. it's whether you get back up. america's been knocked down. that great recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth disappeared. and although we've made progress, we're standing but not running the way america needs to. my mission as president will be to raise incomes for hard-working middle-class families and to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain i was raised with: if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. please join me in this campaign. please come and make it clear that america's best days are still ahead. thank you very

artificially. those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place. and i think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation. this country was -- declared its independence in 1776. in less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. and the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. those are the fuels that drive it. and what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. if we can get that out, it makes a big difference. and even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. and it's shifted to the individual. so -- and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich. they go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it. and the middle class, when they come to the cash register, have a whole cart full of things that cost 5, 10 or 15 cents more, they notice it. it is hurting the poor. bernie sanders and hillary clinton won't tell you that that's

1.2 percent a year on average. the obama economy is a disaster, and the imf is telling us this is a new normal. it doesn't have to be. if you look at the history of america, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth. the first is tax reform. and as you noted, i have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every american that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade. the second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses. and the third element is sound money. every time we've pursued all three of those -- whether in the 1920s with calvin coolidge or the 1960s with jfk or the 1980s with ronald reagan -- the result has been incredible economic growth. we have done it before, and with leadership, we can do it

all over the world. it is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people. what makes america special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard

that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, i would be all for it, but it isn't. in the 20th century, it's a disaster. if you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine. and that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated. here's the best way to raise wages. make america the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. for the life of me, i don't know why we have

principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations. that's how you make peace in the world. you sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding iran stop the support of international terrorism.","class":0,"tokens":[0.6867985725,0.9696286917,2.3592450619,1.6330068111,-1.0961710215,1.8644949198,0.8161603808,-0.5452855229,-0.0584434196,-1.4248683453,0.5070207119,-0.7292299867,-0.1932462007,0.3368220627,-1.0421899557,0.3489091098,-0.2222704291,2.7167174816,0.3101705015,-0.7179942131,0.9028511047,-2.5259315968,-1.1562855244,0.0986497998,-2.0601205826,1.3169723749,-0.3906303048,-0.3271635771,-1.5742689371,-0.7017745376,1.7390991449,0.2733687162,-1.5358921289,-2.2464210987,-1.1280349493,0.0470350198,1.063496232,-0.4269275665,0.8306415677,0.32405442,-0.5174261332,2.0740039349,1.0169608593,-3.6814136505,0.6679416299,0.0070635662,0.7819693685,-0.0377968512,0.3030547798,1.5631051064,-0.0847882926,-0.8885108232,-0.3679217994,0.5781336427,-0.308388859,-1.5918462276,-0.0101657277,-0.444054842,2.0878922939,0.7764043808]},{"index":1672,"text":"right?

first, despite the fact that we are the most generous country in the history of the world in allowing people to come here legally, we have people still coming illegally. second, we have a legal immigration system that no longer works. it primary is built on the basis of whether you have a relative living here instead of merit. and third, we have 11 million or 12 million people, many of whom have been here for longer than a decade who are already here illegally. and we must deal with all three of these problems. we cannot deal with all three of these problems in one massive piece of

an entry\/exit tracking system. 40 percent of the people who come here illegally come legally, and then they overstay the visa. we also need a mandatory e-verify system. after we've done that, step

that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. and who can blame them? they pay tax once overseas. they don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back. so beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money. bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the united states. we'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. and i would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country. it would not necessitate us raising any taxes. it would bring the money back into the united states to help build jobs by american companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. and -- and -- and the last piece of this, maria, is this. you know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in america. he's penalized -- and doesn't understand. in fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers. you've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the obama administration. that's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. we'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively. and remember this -- i'm credible on this for this reason: americans for tax reform says that i've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in american history. we don't need to raise taxes to get this done. we need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the united states to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need

with respect to syria, i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made. the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria. the agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to. you know, the russians wanted to buy time. are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. but i would add this. you know, the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution. at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together. this is incredibly complicated, because we've got iran as a big player, in addition to russia. we have saudi arabia, turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. this is one of the areas i've disagreed with senator sanders on, who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria, which i think would be a grave mistake. putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me. trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. so let's support what secretary kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. and remember, the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups. so as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and the like. so we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the russians.","class":0,"tokens":[3.1577117443,1.6614761353,2.2590813637,1.7286986113,-1.1020720005,-2.1084856987,1.4307074547,0.0834095702,1.1791676283,-0.6015174389,0.1466253996,-1.9169683456,-1.1689454317,0.631278038,-1.1424982548,2.5768296719,-3.011039257,0.5757297873,1.4154808521,-2.6170508862,2.222410202,-1.5042806864,-1.623795867,-1.7213529348,-1.5421837568,0.7538871765,-0.1063327864,3.2546627522,-2.3723819256,0.1564127058,3.0513863564,-0.476079613,1.7426948547,0.6563768387,-1.2704660892,-0.6444167495,0.41706267,0.9046006203,-0.1283135712,0.7307997942,3.3586263657,-0.1302328408,0.1464753747,-1.816806078,-0.5541370511,-1.9454934597,-0.4563239813,-2.0296323299,-0.0508431643,1.3860862255,1.5336598158,1.0225790739,-1.2917785645,-1.9801331758,-1.5411028862,-1.7376629114,-0.4463927448,-1.0032695532,0.7212877274,-1.3673160076]},{"index":1857,"text":"you

let me just very briefly tell you a story. when i was in one of my first years in congress, i went to a meeting downtown in washington, d.c. and i went there with another congressman, an african-american congressman. and then we kind of separated during the meeting. and then i saw him out later on. and he was sitting there waiting and i said, well, let's go out and get a cab. how come you didn't go out and get a cab? he said, no, i don't get cabs in washington, d.c. this was 20 years ago. because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black. i couldn't believe, you know, you just sit there and you say, this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in washington, d.c. tell you another story, i was with young people active in the black lives matter movement. a young lady comes up to me and she says, you don't understand what police do in certain black communities. you don't understand the degree to which we are terrorized, and i'm not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we've got to hold police officers accountable, i'm just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people. so to answer your question, i would say, and i think it's similar to what the secretary said, when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto. you don't know what it's like to be poor. you don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car. and i believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear. we will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system.","class":0,"tokens":[0.1947081238,-1.4733960629,1.9856981039,1.83155334,0.3914074898,0.5097171664,0.7347826362,-1.438916564,1.5132569075,2.0676329136,-1.0216374397,-0.2121175826,0.8523166776,-1.2870180607,0.6471130252,-1.1157245636,-0.7298933864,2.2046465874,0.6142645478,-1.0258226395,-0.3262671232,1.3429135084,1.4660644531,1.5581400394,-0.3716543317,0.2660932243,0.7827317715,-0.2839707732,-0.0625406951,0.1427439153,-1.3947116137,1.9530067444,0.9640594721,0.1065779924,-0.7046420574,2.4979629517,1.6189984083,-1.0146945715,-1.4898706675,0.3679531515,-1.3600686789,1.38826406,1.2090263367,-1.4125254154,0.2919695079,0.6118084192,-0.6840855479,0.0073553929,0.9704690576,1.6425361633,-0.7521827221,-0.8833639622,-0.3520748615,0.3465368748,1.5082139969,-2.6769332886,0.3778598011,2.2071936131,-0.7623815536,-0.5950815678]},{"index":1863,"text":"wolf,

first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of america safe. i have a plan that i've put forward to go after isis. not to contain

network of terrorism. and thirdly, to do more to keep us safe. under each of those three parts of my plan, i have very specific recommendations about what to do. obviously, in the first, we do have to

because we have seen that isis is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence. that means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies. they can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists. we've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning. and we must work more
