president. i've said myself, we will not send american combat troops back to either syria or iraq -- that is off the table. but we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the united states is leading so that we can try to take out isis infrastructure, take out their leadership. and i think that, given the threat that isis poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the sunni tribes in anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the kurds to provide them the support, but they're doing the fighting. we're doing the support and enabling. and i also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take isis on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home. so as i look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me. we just have to keep -- try to get more support for those people on the ground in syria and iraq who have to actually physically take the territory

let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they're related. as i've said many times before, my parents were never rich people. my father was a bartender. my mother was a maid. they worked for a living. but they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves. we call that the american dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. it is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people. what makes america special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful. the problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. if i thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, i would be all for it, but it isn't. in the 20th century, it's a disaster. if you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine. and that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated. here's the best way to raise wages. make america the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. for the life of me, i don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education. welders make more money than philosophers. we need more welders and less philosophers.","class":1,"tokens":[0.3631948829,-0.5790075064,0.1605703086,-2.478801012,-2.6341035366,1.7105531693,0.3454529047,0.1508022547,0.3438110948,2.4943230152,-0.4514292479,-0.6329530478,-0.7270648479,-1.4869565964,-1.3382228613,0.2961376309,0.1217204705,0.319915086,-1.6426122189,0.2528350055,-1.436106205,1.5375965834,0.2458693236,0.429095,-0.9350094199,1.0017328262,1.9072657824,-0.6806282401,2.7842085361,0.9862098694,1.1544889212,0.7585969567,-0.6995133758,-0.207890898,1.1338680983,1.3812621832,1.933503747,-1.0507688522,0.0810572356,3.7304115295,3.0906128883,-0.2955204844,-1.5260003805,-0.7274922132,0.9868345857,-0.1820909232,-0.2224735618,-0.9612721205,0.5466768146,-0.2618414164]},{"index":60,"text":"well,

the bill that i wanted, but probably the most comprehensive v.a. health care bill in the modern history of this country. secretary clinton is absolutely right, there are people, koch brothers among others, who have a group called concerned veterans of america, funded by the koch brothers. the koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy social security, medicare, medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s. yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it. the last point that i'd make. i had a hearing. i had all of the veterans groups in front of me. and i said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the v.a., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good? without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good. we've got to strengthen the v.a. we do not privatize the

prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education. so under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system. secondly, i don't believe in free tuition for everybody. i believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead. so i have proposed debt free tuition, which i think is affordable and i would move a lot of the pell grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense. so i put all of this together, again, on my website and i've gotten such a good response. but i want to quickly say, one of the areas that senator sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems. free college, a single payer system for health--and it's been estimated we're looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget. and i have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run. and i think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that i have proposed i will tell you exactly how i'm going to pay for it; including college.","class":0,"tokens":[1.5124715567,-1.5476973057,-0.1008561328,-0.9213103056,-0.8247247934,1.606192708,-0.8555070162,1.8439065218,0.1976543814,-1.8732048273,0.6858141422,1.6995476484,-1.2889480591,-1.4147593975,-0.5899139643,0.3571259379,-0.4864301383,1.4624050856,1.1949609518,-2.0840446949,-0.1838620901,-1.0322650671,0.6568001509,-1.286205411,-2.3466663361,-0.3578510284,-1.0269477367,0.7781912684,0.5926523209,0.9030691981,1.2079170942,1.5768831968,-2.6779026985,0.8234491944,-1.3252797127,2.5880234241,-0.0853356272,1.7552667856,0.8527668715,1.8003667593,1.0902321339,-2.9946777821,-2.3184144497,1.9524554014,0.334002167,-1.9175525904,2.9381217957,-0.2632744312,-0.7591202259,0.3528148532]},{"index":165,"text":"well,

john, i come from the '60s, a long time ago. there was a lot of activism on campus -- civil rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and i do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out. obviously, i believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other. but what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, i think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have... you know, i recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking. each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture. you know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down. or a young woman who had been performing at president obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member. and, of course, i met the mothers of eric garner and tamir rice, and michael brown and trayvon martin and so many of them who have lost their children. so, your original question is the right question. and it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer. it's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the

not only does snowden violate the law, but it appears he committed treason. treason is defined under the constitution as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of america, and what snowden did made it easier for terrorists to avoid detection. and snowden's comments afterwards, and his behavior afterwards, he fled to russia, he fled to china. his conducts afterwards indicates that he was not a

strengthened the tools of national security and law enforcement to go after terrorists. it gave us greater tools and we are seeing those tools work right now in san bernardino. and in particular, what it did is the prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. when you had a terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily land lines. the usa

businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now. the big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this. and what i think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise. the government has tried it their way. under -- under barack obama and the proposals of hillary clinton and bernie sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably. we need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.","class":1,"tokens":[-1.4207532406,-1.2272018194,-1.6183617115,-1.1558150053,0.3678750098,0.4391322434,0.417961657,0.8818235993,1.0936625004,-0.0723928884,0.5454827547,-1.5426212549,-2.7880871296,-1.1835583448,-0.1195070967,-0.974419415,-1.5919452906,-0.4976745844,1.0887461901,-0.4690670371,-0.3552978337,-0.3972616792,-0.7870312333,1.2899773121,-0.8978622556,-1.2244216204,2.0621201992,1.5232316256,1.0327231884,-0.6162561178,1.0964881182,0.3373424113,-1.1142308712,1.4412477016,0.9670755267,2.3479292393,-0.3699714839,2.3939197063,-0.4892340004,0.2951387465,1.7251499891,0.0474124327,-1.4291498661,0.2097805291,0.5126920938,-0.6090624332,1.091586113,-0.7980077863,1.2707140446,1.1098495722]},{"index":311,"text":"well,

lead to the death of dontre hamilton right here in milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us. his family certainly believes that. and so do i. so we have work to do. there have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. president obama's policing commission came out with some. i have fully endorsed those. but we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect. and, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level. but, i would also add this. there are other racial discrepancies. really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities. so, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.","class":0,"tokens":[-1.019125104,-0.1495017409,-1.0647987127,0.1613571346,0.9538029432,0.61702317,-0.7454918623,0.7960415483,0.1649301797,1.7049555779,1.539586544,2.5186910629,0.7664734125,1.2640064955,1.0343705416,1.2741377354,-0.2119483352,-0.5201975107,-1.1291826963,0.3610821068,-0.0074322666,0.9997088313,1.7106359005,-0.9003638029,-2.8923807144,0.0899798274,1.8772680759,-1.2231810093,-2.2167789936,3.0948364735,1.0913208723,-0.4807207584,-1.233009696,-1.076387763,-0.5424147248,0.9190623164,-1.2464321852,-0.5045924187,-0.1868277341,0.3508875966,-0.1064802036,-2.6360788345,-1.1090891361,-0.7351123095,0.1399632543,-0.7043936253,-0.0099905599,-1.8615384102,-0.296631813,-1.0619564056]},{"index":406,"text":"i

with allies around the world to protect democratic values, that we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity. i voted against the war in iraq because i listened very carefully to what president bush and vice president cheney had to say and i didn't believe them. and if you go to my web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what i feared would happen when i spoke on the floor of the house, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. now i think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where secretary clinton and i disagree is the area of regime change. look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the united states, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. and god only knows saddam hussein was a brutal dictator. we could overthrow assad tomorrow if we wanted to. we got rid of gadhafi. but the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after. and in libya, for example, the united states, secretary clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi. but what happened is a political vacuum developed. isis came in, and now occupies significant territory in libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. but this is nothing new. this has gone on 50 or 60 years where the united states has been involved in overthrowing governments. mossadegh back in 1953. nobody knows who mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of iran. he was overthrown by british and american interests because he threatened oil interests of the british. and as a result of that, the shah of iran came in, terrible dictator. the result of that, you had the iranian revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. unintended consequences. so i believe as president i will look very carefully about unintended consequences. i will do everything i can to make certain that the united states and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the middle east.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.8192780018,0.5791165233,-1.1059195995,0.6993450522,-0.1585438251,-1.4818913937,-0.4203183949,1.382948637,-1.4468353987,2.1182448864,-0.562564075,1.6300603151,-0.2792086303,0.9275708199,-0.3162499368,0.3567212522,-1.0918135643,1.7414218187,1.6654574871,0.2887240052,1.7206677198,1.879571557,3.2366709709,-0.1079942286,0.0157970246,-1.9265658855,1.4145846367,0.7495957613,-1.8093822002,-0.1297432184,1.4988133907,-3.1813969612,-1.3505535126,-0.6251121759,-0.0832709596,-2.3595855236,-0.7241698503,-1.4794491529,-2.095562458,2.7727982998,-0.6511560082,-0.1931414902,1.7797371149,1.0972841978,0.8744592071,0.2805494666,0.9813036919,-1.1364330053,-1.461848855,1.8636442423]},{"index":434,"text":"all

obama\/clinton policy of toppling the government in libya. that was a disaster. it gave the country over to radical islamic terrorism and it endangered america. another example is john kerry. john kerry -- senator rubio voted to confirm john kerry as secretary of state. i voted against him. and donald trump supported john kerry against george w. bush in 2004, gave him a check. and john kerry has been the most anti-israel secretary of state this country has ever seen. his diplomacy has been a disaster. and if we nominate someone who agreed with john kerry, barack obama and hillary clinton on foreign policy, we're not in a strong position to win the general election.","class":1,"tokens":[0.1553551257,-0.5381807685,-0.2149675936,1.2116830349,-0.2076349258,-2.0720894337,1.7195183039,0.0353306867,-0.7956696749,1.4133291245,1.2821588516,-0.2614352107,-1.2613009214,0.3340037465,-0.0896774605,-0.4529899359,-0.7503299713,1.9629918337,-0.3419489563,-0.0645215735,2.1051764488,-0.3138096631,1.0921978951,2.8581793308,-0.4119076431,-0.6927380562,0.1773360819,0.33435601,-1.1936300993,-0.1082687229,-0.1484047621,-1.9801388979,1.048833251,-2.6174097061,0.0794855803,0.105483301,0.2705412805,-2.2985515594,0.2868979275,1.261480093,-0.3530609608,-0.3612405062,-2.1613960266,0.4552194178,0.7453687191,0.0008878322,-0.1255702078,0.8639665842,1.3398994207,-0.8655909896]},{"index":548,"text":"the

about is bringing america together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.1217351556,0.0560505688,-0.784319818,-0.215563938,0.2989017069,-0.5786368847,-1.1423685551,1.2036828995,0.2294683456,-0.4080099463,2.0333588123,0.6559860706,0.7932349443,-0.6740829945,0.08190687,0.2001185864,-1.291960597,0.3959764242,0.2585057318,-0.0918113515,-0.5143066645,0.2896048725,-0.4452418387,0.834828496,-0.0356346443,-0.7091363072,-0.1219390184,0.5745765567,0.3722245395,0.5393586159,0.7093245387,-0.5499534607,-1.5106511116,-0.7364446521,0.5788516402,1.8458702564,0.4526447654,-0.1817385256,-0.205674842,0.873180151,0.5637485385,-1.4409160614,-0.2611247897,-1.2884341478,-0.3455978036,1.0494302511,0.5612507463,-0.8815000057,1.5266368389,0.2796291411]},{"index":575,"text":"and

you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. but let me just say this. in terms of where we are right now, as you mention, rachel, in a number of national and state, including new hampshire. for example, the last poll i saw -- there may have been a new one -- last one i saw here in new hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. there were also pretty large margins in iowa and wisconsin. these are polls. polls go up. polls go down. but here's why i think i will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process. republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. i believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout. if there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the white house, but i think we regain the senate. we win governors' chairs up and down the line. so i believe if you want to retain the white house, if you want to see democrats do well across the board, i think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.","class":0,"tokens":[-2.1351001263,0.3202683628,-2.2729914188,1.4453396797,0.8314226866,-0.8741309047,-1.3213133812,1.1635007858,-0.0124340737,1.7945766449,-0.7506400347,-0.8514847159,-1.5928115845,-0.1551327258,-0.0461591668,1.3698227406,-1.6538931131,3.7647697926,0.9773292542,0.3719296753,-1.1271926165,1.7115169764,-1.826182127,4.2658038139,1.0642440319,0.7631558776,-0.0859858841,-0.8349254131,-0.6889767647,0.2230482996,-1.2654217482,0.6195741296,-0.685087502,-0.9886590838,-1.5050690174,-0.0556082614,-2.1672596931,-0.9825644493,-0.7477408051,0.7696886063,-1.3843046427,-1.851880312,1.1224751472,0.0831338838,-0.2192080617,1.6452647448,-0.3124592304,-0.8351608515,2.3084614277,1.2002004385]},{"index":733,"text":"but

jersey. and when jim comey gets up before congress and says, we cannot effectively vet these people, for me as president, that's the end of the conversation. we have to put america's security first.","class":1,"tokens":[0.2165997326,0.3376687169,1.0335165262,0.3277229369,-0.1084414572,-0.2022942454,-1.3972051144,-1.6863584518,-1.1620489359,0.583871603,0.7798330188,0.7002689242,1.047824502,1.2015743256,-0.8772671819,-1.711446166,-2.04991436,0.4829698205,-0.7428981066,-1.2637224197,-0.7748292089,0.217661038,-0.414421469,1.6676713228,-0.4592261016,-0.6504867673,0.1638964415,0.9513635039,-0.5838205218,0.4976333976,0.4200752378,0.2382131219,-1.4564538002,-0.2654612958,0.6021861434,0.431488812,0.6964605451,-0.7771018744,-1.4615110159,0.8039513826,0.8286018372,-0.8551344872,0.3316040635,0.1518464983,-0.1125557646,-0.0069827251,-0.14359653,-0.8050740361,-0.4691657722,0.082020916]},{"index":921,"text":"on

the economy growing? how do we bring back economic growth? because economic growth, it's foundational to every other challenge we have. as you rightly noted, from 2008 to today, our economy has grown 1.2 percent a year on average. the obama economy is a disaster, and the imf is telling us this is a new normal. it doesn't have to be. if you look at the history of america, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth. the first is tax reform. and as you noted, i have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every american that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade. the second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses. and the third element is sound money. every time we've pursued all three of those -- whether in the 1920s with calvin coolidge or the 1960s with jfk or the 1980s with ronald reagan -- the result has been incredible economic growth. we have done it before, and with leadership, we can do it

middle east, we've done a tremendous disservice to humanity. the people that have been killed, the people that have wiped away, and for what? it's not like we had victory. it's a mess. the middle east

everything else that are all falling

the rich kids who use drugs aren't. i personally think that this is a crime for which the only victim is the individual, and i think that america has to take a different attitude. i would like to see more rehabilitation and less incarceration. i'm a fan of the drug courts which try to direct you back towards work and less time in jail. but the bottom line is the states. we say we like the 10th amendment, until we start talking about this. and i think the federal government has gone too far, i think that the war on drugs has had a racial outcome, and really has been something that has really damaged our inner cities. not only do the drugs damage them, we damage them again by incarcerating them and then preventing them from getting employment over time. so i don't think that the federal

run by democrats and countries currently run by democrats. so the thing is, let's look for root causes. but i would also say -- lay some blame at the -- the feet of the federal reserve. i think the federal reserve has made this problem worse. by artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money. they're actually talking now about negative interest. the money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in new york. and because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. so what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality. we also find that as the federal reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst. so really we need to reexamine whether we not -- we want a federal reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates. we also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse. but the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a city with a republican mayor or a state with a republican governor.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.7682148814,-0.232914269,-0.9347531796,-2.3008234501,2.988307476,1.8195636272,0.1731857508,1.6617878675,3.8633704185,1.4722089767,0.2643531859,-2.2235217094,-1.1943757534,0.3975977302,-1.2118973732,1.3352552652,0.451269269,1.7766541243,-1.5621267557,-0.5012165308,-1.5612441301,-1.251506567,0.6918372512,-0.887483716,-0.3658849299,0.8342704773,0.5771785378,0.9968874454,1.7212052345,-0.3785886765,1.1444176435,-0.3917772174,-0.5172864199,-0.5062654614,0.4450547099,1.4619847536,-1.8248165846,-0.598530829,2.080627203,0.9674354792,-0.4585077465,-0.9186369181,-1.4968079329,1.3357533216,0.7985907793,0.8454116583,0.6857950687,-1.8999305964,1.6440683603,-0.1857059896]},{"index":1052,"text":"well,

just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we've got to hold police officers accountable, i'm just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people. so to answer your question, i would say, and i think it's similar to what the secretary said, when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto. you don't know what it's like to be poor. you don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car. and i believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear. we will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.9222089648,-0.2226424217,-0.4908539951,-0.4490123987,-1.2089811563,0.7859067917,-3.1237254143,-0.6658864617,0.4492650926,0.6494043469,0.0580627769,1.010650754,2.6186788082,1.5400189161,-1.1014795303,-1.6140218973,1.1441339254,1.9480866194,-0.4082251787,-1.5149663687,-0.67623353,2.3103964329,1.5437097549,1.0922629833,0.37077263,0.4864003658,1.3400033712,1.034009099,-3.336618185,0.5191113353,1.9587309361,1.8076438904,-1.3626852036,-0.158825174,0.2572717667,0.7051770091,0.6741157174,0.5509197116,0.1048061401,-0.043668136,-0.7643058896,-1.708830595,0.0982906297,-0.8179324269,0.9131405354,-0.010799503,-0.1072624922,-0.5591085553,0.0493853316,0.6131189466]},{"index":1162,"text":"no,

with respect to syria, i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made. the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria. the agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to. you know, the russians wanted to buy time. are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. but i would add this. you know, the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution. at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together. this is incredibly complicated, because we've got iran as a big player, in addition to russia. we have saudi arabia, turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. this is one of the areas i've disagreed with senator sanders on, who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria, which i think would be a grave mistake. putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me. trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. so let's support what secretary kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. and remember, the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups. so as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and the like. so we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the russians.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.7198020816,1.5561640263,1.0347397327,0.475890547,-0.6307858825,-0.7764735818,2.0145893097,2.7153623104,-2.6262938976,0.6211073995,3.0275225639,3.2019963264,-1.8987090588,0.8508848548,0.1722925752,0.9932208657,-1.1692556143,0.3602505624,0.1837719381,1.4410330057,-2.7964890003,-1.1736903191,2.4840731621,1.0009543896,-1.5020854473,-1.6735399961,-1.3608762026,3.2751631737,-2.4290902615,0.2324281037,-1.4457368851,-2.8168969154,-0.8219621778,-4.6538295746,2.1675562859,-0.1576633751,-2.897485733,1.2874487638,-1.9973062277,0.6006948352,-1.1721403599,-0.5986808538,-0.4082042277,2.8533723354,-1.192676425,0.5733510852,0.4302410483,0.4447039068,0.8857715726,0.2190704942]},{"index":1185,"text":"let

the united states has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as scalia -- plus there may be at least two other vacancies. so you ask mr. trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would. but the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side. now, if he's changed, we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement. but the bottom line is that, if you don't have a record there to look at and say, \"i feel at peace that when donald trump is president of the united states, he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues.\" in fact, very recently, he was still defending planned parenthood. he says he's not going to take sides in the palestinians versus israel. these are concerning things. and so, yes, i have a doubt about whether donald trump, if he becomes president, will replace justice scalia with someone just like justice

can continue to do so from any company in america they want to buy it from. otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country. and if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. and that, i think, is a much better approach than obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy. it is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time. it is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. and i will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all

asked her for a job and she said she didn't have any money. i was working my way through law school and she said if i could get a job and get myself paid, she would give me a job. so i got law

missile capability. and, i know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach hawaii, if not the west coast. we do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them. but, what secretary carter is looking at is the constant pressure that russia's putting on our european allies. the way that russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-world war ii europe. the way that he is trying to set european countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in crimea. beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the baltics. we know that they are deeply engaged in supporting assad because they want to have a place in the middle east. they have a naval base, they have an air base in syria. they want to hang on to that. i think what secretary carter is seeing, and i'm glad he is, is that we got to get nato back working for the common defense. we've got to do more to support our partners in nato, and we have to send a very clear message to putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. the best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the europeans in so they're actually contributing more to their own

has been a resurgence of sunni activities, as exemplified by isis. and we have to support sunni-arab and kurdish forces against isis, because i believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the united states to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what isis wants. they've advertised that. they want american troops back in the middle east. they want american soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity. so, i think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of american troops into syria and iraq to fight isis. and we do have to form a coalition. i know how hard that is. i have formed them. i put together a coalition, including arabs, with respect to libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto iran. and you have to really work hard at it. and the final thing i would say, bringing

web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details. and i will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment. and i can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.","class":0,"tokens":[0.0773240775,-1.7363125086,-0.1130322516,-1.2187279463,-0.5310632586,0.7608264089,-0.9329431057,-0.2761894763,0.0263190903,0.8950468898,-0.1087156087,0.3227477968,-0.850903213,-0.6759304404,-1.3904887438,-0.6430088878,-0.1553484201,-0.0211816616,0.1260619462,0.1026387736,-1.410771966,0.2204632014,1.0540784597,-0.3669069111,-2.3140218258,-0.5228577256,0.7288388014,1.249871254,2.3653767109,0.5252572298,1.3814861774,1.5438708067,-0.5229005218,-0.1738096476,-0.356023252,0.5038167834,-0.3254523873,0.0485849828,-0.5443583727,1.3209024668,-0.7771692872,0.3049990237,-2.5068731308,-1.9166808128,0.7592346072,-0.0486298725,-0.4629054964,-1.0513910055,0.0384617932,-0.5705577731]},{"index":1676,"text":"you're

that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. and who can blame them? they pay tax once overseas. they don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back. so beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money. bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the united states. we'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. and i would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country. it would not necessitate us raising any taxes. it would

done. we need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the united states to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need

the numbers add up? i would encourage folks, if you go to our website, tedcruz.org, we have the specific numbers on the website. this plan eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,

artificially. those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place. and i think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation. this country was -- declared its independence in 1776. in less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. and the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. those are the fuels that drive it. and what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. if we can get that out, it makes a big difference. and even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. and it's shifted to the individual. so

share. but i think the american people deserve to know specifically how this would work. if it's medicare for all, then you no longer have the affordable care act, because the affordable care act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. the children's health insurance program, which i helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program. so if you're having medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. and based on

cost of living goes up. this is all the young people coming out of school with student loans up to their eyeballs that aren't able to find a job. and i don't think the people of america are interested in a bunch of bickering school children. they are interested in solutions, not slogans. it's easy to say, make things better, make things great. you can even print it and put it on a baseball cap. but the question is, do you understand the principles that made america great in the first place? as president, i will repeal every word of obamacare. i will pull back the regulators that are killing small businesses. and we will pass a simple flat tax and abolish the irs. and what that's going to do, megyn, is small businesses are going to explode. we are going to see millions of high-paying jobs. we are going to see wages going up. we are going to see opportunity. that's where our focus needs to be. that's where my focus is. and that is why our campaign is the only campaign that over and over again has beaten donald trump to date, and it's why we are the one campaign that going forward can and will beat donald trump in this election.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.6450924277,-0.7308093905,-2.2668735981,0.1493128687,-0.2198785543,2.4259135723,-1.0108749866,-0.1595132649,1.1717823744,-0.43198511,0.1180537045,0.4406246841,0.5198068619,-0.1357748955,-1.3509036303,-1.7757133245,-0.9117488861,-0.560942173,-0.5787512064,1.6934603453,-0.8916977048,0.2169821858,-0.3391268849,1.2759194374,-0.4241669774,2.2540025711,-1.1390388012,0.6239336729,0.6055378914,0.6028205752,0.970998764,-0.6563119888,1.0895998478,0.859875381,1.594263792,1.8408848047,0.3413282633,-1.3996776342,-0.4437279701,1.3520314693,0.2198168337,0.5979223251,0.5026755929,-0.8037309051,1.1049638987,-0.443113625,0.4576869309,-0.6459808946,2.8487858772,0.8285131454]},{"index":1845,"text":"well,

had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, i recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of gadhafi. i think that what libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path. now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the arab spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that isis and other terrorist groups do. but what we're seeing happening in libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among libyans themselves to try to dislodge isis from sirte, the home town of gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government. you know, this is not easy work. we did a lot to help. we did as much as we could because the libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept. but we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be
