son of an immigrant who came to this country from poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, never made a whole lot of money, but was a very proud american, because this country gave him

political life. and i disagree with secretary clinton in the belief that you can get money from wall street, that you can get money for a super pac from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country. i just don't accept that. what i believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes. and we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.","class":0,"tokens":[0.6104141474,-0.8174858689,-0.5496888161,1.1444400549,-0.2578916252,0.1478887647,0.6408367753,2.2262465954,-0.0814282149,0.359424293,-0.5856990814,0.7509138584,-0.970689714,-0.9474136233,-0.4844890535,-0.6683228016,0.0945049897,2.4626281261,1.8287979364,0.7937088609,0.2941963077,1.6882178783,-0.039643053,0.0728034228,-0.1112603098,0.4506638646,0.309968859,-0.7666099072,0.8615909815,0.2241596878,0.932931602,-0.9881742597,0.0826726407,-0.035942141,-0.6911876798,-0.2903990149,0.3999209106,-1.4946446419,-0.1251356006,0.448695004,1.6830878258,0.9603788853,-0.4013903141,0.2518906593,0.9863390923,0.7038559914,-0.636116147,-1.3431459665,0.707547307,2.0503900051,0.4818500876,-1.4862222672,-0.3588419557,-0.0442306548,1.918804884,-0.9590197802,0.0955542102,2.0739073753,0.4675953984,1.1564497948]},{"index":1,"text":"one of the things that made ronald reagan a great president, is that he understood that america was a unique nation, like any other that had existed throughout human history. he knew it was founded on universal principles that were powerful, the dignity of all people, human rights, the rights of all to live in freedom and liberty, and choose their own path in life. he didn't just believe it, he acted on it. that's why bringing down communism was so important to him. if i'm honored with the opportunity to be president, i hope that our air force one will fly, first and foremost, to our allies; in israel, in south korea, and japan. they know we stand with them. that america can be counted on. it would also fly to china, not just to meet with our enemies, not just to meet with those adversaries of ours that are there, but also to meet with those that aspire to freedom and liberty within china. i would even invite them to my inauguration. we would also fly into moscow and into

bill, we had an opportunity. there was a conservative consensus for an amendment i put forward called trust, but verify that would have strengthened border security on both refugees, students and those coming here. and marco sided and i guess was more sympathetic to chuck schumer and to the president than he was to conservative principles. but this goes directly to national defense. and if he wants to run as a national -- national defense conservative, he's got to explain why he hasn't stepped up to support border security.","class":1,"tokens":[0.8949617743,-0.9533654451,2.2131378651,0.8428863883,1.4278031588,-0.6180434227,2.9607498646,-0.1737681031,-0.6847826242,0.0125945862,0.1336463988,-0.0961960703,0.2653364837,0.0692775324,-0.6515809894,-1.4734973907,-0.8651336432,-0.8991122842,-0.5885746479,1.5652338266,0.0570419468,-0.2068704218,0.0598942116,-0.3574775755,-0.0705548823,2.9310889244,-2.5446465015,-0.9396060109,1.7622694969,0.9440687299,-0.2738620043,1.1537902355,-0.6492522359,-0.7140203714,0.0886046216,-0.8180521131,1.5397572517,-0.1377572566,-3.2250916958,-0.7939110398,0.1113369167,0.9844456315,1.1410809755,0.0514661036,-1.7024359703,1.1584484577,2.0196075439,0.8386918902,-0.5003737211,0.9839131832,1.4638322592,0.5273550153,-1.1310707331,-0.7808080316,-2.2323422432,-0.8062722683,0.0925690904,1.1966091394,1.0103722811,0.159095332]},{"index":82,"text":"well,

that information was looked at. our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing. a few days ago a similar incident happened. there was a breach because the dnc vendor screwed up, information

investing in infrastructure, by investing in the skills and the talents of our people with debt-free college, and we can do it again. and we also create a better future for our kids when we square our

they're actually talking now about negative interest. the money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in new york. and because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. so what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality. we also find that as the federal reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst. so really we need to reexamine whether we not -- we want a federal reserve that's involved so much

the republicans, i think we should actually expand social security and increase average monthly benefits. but look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains. if we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our

have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining american democracy, which allows wall street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice. and aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. and that's an economy where ordinary americans are working longer hours for low wagers. they are worried to death about the future of their kids. and yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent. and then in addition to that, the american people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. they see more people in jail in the united states of america than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. we're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow americans. they see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on wall street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. no criminal records for them. i think what our campaign is indicating is that the american people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. they want a political revolution in which millions of americans stand up, come together, not let the trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors. thank

share. but i think the american people deserve to know specifically how this would work. if it's medicare for all, then you no longer have the affordable care act, because the affordable care act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. the children's health insurance program, which i helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program. so if you're having medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. and based on

1.2 percent a year on average. the obama economy is a disaster, and the imf is telling us this is a new normal. it doesn't have to be. if you look at the history of america, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth. the first is tax reform. and as you noted, i have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every american that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade. the second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses. and the third element is sound money. every time we've pursued all three of those -- whether in the 1920s with calvin coolidge or the 1960s with jfk or the 1980s with ronald reagan -- the result has been incredible

that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. and who can blame them? they pay tax once overseas. they don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back. so beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money. bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the united states. we'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. and i would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country. it would not necessitate us raising any taxes. it would bring the money back into the united states to help build jobs by american companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. and -- and -- and the last piece of this, maria, is this. you know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in america. he's penalized -- and doesn't understand. in fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers. you've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the obama administration. that's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country. we'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively. and remember this -- i'm credible on this for this reason: americans for tax reform says that i've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in american history. we don't need to raise taxes to get this done. we need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the united states to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need

law-abiding, who are in this country, and somehow pick them up at their house and ship them out of mexico -- to mexico, think about the families. think about the children. so, you know what the answer really is? if they have been law- abiding, they pay a penalty. they get to stay. we protect the wall. anybody else comes over, they go back. but for the 11 million people, come on, folks. we all know you can't pick them up and ship them across, back across the border. it's a silly argument. it is not an adult argument. it makes no sense.","class":1,"tokens":[2.9966394901,0.3422923684,1.0834305286,1.3229484558,-0.0590340942,-1.6622095108,0.5210059881,0.2419056147,0.050231792,2.324785471,-1.7427589893,-0.1553073525,0.3415314853,0.8403309584,0.3194544911,0.4900729358,0.4432849586,-0.6588985324,0.3169568777,0.4728603959,-0.2122602165,0.1117442399,0.3094211519,-0.3992245495,0.3648011982,1.2939349413,-0.788762033,0.6920545697,0.5317419171,1.6048570871,0.6585728526,0.2588044107,0.9078499079,0.0307570938,1.4851973057,0.4349437356,-0.2344335467,-0.4740203619,-0.9455994964,0.7040394545,1.6531772614,2.8060033321,-1.5770261288,0.5520089269,-0.5746831894,1.719611764,0.3041152954,-0.9038786888,0.7538781166,0.4719804525,0.0457334332,0.9577109218,0.265627563,-0.0722127482,-0.3579676449,-0.6037042141,-2.2432682514,-1.083356142,0.3278329074,1.2084732056]},{"index":442,"text":"well,

any state in the country. and if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. and that, i think, is a much better approach than obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy. it is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's

that. we know what it takes to do that. it takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. it takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. it takes a mandatory e-verify system and a mandatory entry\/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. after we have done that, the second thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal immigration system. and after we have done those two things, i think the american people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn't otherwise violated our laws -- because if they're a criminal they can't stay. they'll have to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. and ultimately, they'll given a work permit and that's all they're gonna be allowed to have for at

let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they're related. as i've said many times before, my parents were never rich people. my father was a bartender. my mother was a maid. they worked for a living. but they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves. we call that the american dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. it is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people. what makes america special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful. the problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. if i thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, i would be all for it, but it isn't. in the 20th century, it's a disaster. if you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine. and that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated. here's the best way to raise wages. make america the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. for the life of me, i don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education. welders make more money than philosophers. we need more welders and less philosophers.","class":1,"tokens":[-1.7667005062,0.3707354367,-1.6340675354,0.7545332909,0.81382972,-1.3093745708,-0.6510542631,-1.9207010269,-0.3975044787,0.8374590874,-1.9469958544,1.4679487944,-0.0264593586,-1.0124589205,-0.8120022416,-1.0326851606,1.0641872883,0.2158639282,-0.574290812,-0.3255019486,0.44478634,0.4145222604,-1.4148904085,-1.6188561916,1.743412137,0.3640953898,-0.3457076848,1.8541530371,0.4902636707,-0.0603789389,0.3090807498,-0.4131698608,0.5004535913,0.2534979582,1.6216278076,-2.4810614586,0.0940232873,-2.1253349781,-0.3641037941,1.2393270731,1.2967560291,1.8190850019,-0.4719399512,1.179800272,1.7005091906,1.7414939404,1.5481479168,0.2563880086,-0.118654795,3.1880443096,1.0738301277,-1.9851621389,-0.6165969372,-1.0964422226,1.0676571131,1.4949606657,0.5919508338,-0.7323661447,0.1567392647,1.4107329845]},{"index":468,"text":"nancy,

you can, because african-americans and latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. so, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. but it is a general economic issue. and here's what the economic issue is. the wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. why is that? because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate america through nafta and permanent normal trade relations with china, secretary clinton and i disagree on those issues. but view is those trade policies have enabled corporate america to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. but you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits. you once had a pension. those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. they're off to china. now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone. what have you got now? you are working at mcdonald's? that is why there is massive despair all over this country. people have worked their entire lives. they're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all. and that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down. suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political

met.","class":0,"tokens":[-0.8137530684,-0.9562051892,-1.6530833244,1.7379404306,0.5629004836,-1.3386161327,-0.1017512456,-0.1791761518,-1.1542755365,-0.002146414,-0.2075191438,0.4691670835,-0.5190595388,1.104596138,2.1666777134,-0.2994787991,0.2094571143,0.1457380801,-0.0088223424,0.3104619682,-0.7965021729,0.3541194201,1.8254081011,-0.3066740632,1.1186287403,-0.6467356682,1.2886019945,1.0426132679,1.3423938751,0.8819752932,1.1344465017,0.5537950397,-1.616781354,0.2171403766,-0.6525332332,1.2573565245,-1.6620069742,-0.2698104978,-0.3460391164,1.4469759464,0.8376107216,0.7133996487,1.2520574331,1.6874796152,0.4895609319,-0.8099918962,0.6169252992,-0.6943373084,0.9681344628,1.2125351429,-0.0514527149,0.6597845554,0.3193308711,-0.282230109,-0.7331626415,-0.5703276396,-0.7131988406,-0.1190846264,0.6236722469,1.1041657925]},{"index":570,"text":"let

isis from sirte, the home town of gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government. you know, this is not easy work. we did a lot to help. we did as much as we could because the libyans

and let me give you an example. universities today have so many non-academic assets. at ohio state they sold the parking garage and the parking lot, and they got $500 million because they shouldn't be in the parking lot business. they shouldn't be in the ding business, they shouldn't be in the dorm business. and, of course, we need to take advantage of on-line education to reduce these costs and

public service and begin to pay off some of that debt through the public service that you do. and in the meantime, it may inspire us to care more about our country, more about ourselves. this is a big

prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education. so under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system.

movement.","class":1,"tokens":[0.0941406041,0.5552768111,0.4122613966,0.923155427,0.5767353773,-0.206675753,0.150014773,-0.7016010284,1.1348147392,1.1377205849,1.2944703102,0.6510801911,0.2679618895,0.3083950281,-1.6633270979,0.7921698093,0.3327135146,0.8120191693,0.6241834164,-0.5507800579,0.1048811972,1.6006702185,-0.4205541313,0.1475035101,0.3032574654,1.3979706764,-0.3859457076,-0.4490093291,1.0219409466,-0.8954746127,1.1071970463,0.7915000916,-0.4515116811,-0.5899990201,0.176002115,0.5671908855,-0.1075452417,1.0741698742,-0.4895518422,-0.6415283084,-0.1879271269,1.077283144,0.5173059702,0.2439711541,0.0088252565,0.7486307025,1.1285247803,1.2969089746,-0.628059864,1.4204688072,0.2661541104,-0.4227980673,-0.4427205324,-0.0790198967,0.2310912907,-0.8703661561,-0.5001045465,0.5709210038,-0.4022819102,-1.0103515387]},{"index":730,"text":"a

think -- i think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement. we both believe there has to be more money going into the social security system. i've said i'm looking at a couple of different ways,

slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. first, rather than expand benefits for everyone, i do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. i want to take care of women. when the social security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. and women have been disadvantaged ever since. they do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. and the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their social security monthly payment. so

situation. this country was -- declared its independence in 1776. in less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. and the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. those are the fuels that drive it. and what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. if we can get that out, it makes a big difference. and even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. and it's shifted to the individual. so

let's start -- i've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes -- let's start with why russia is in syria right now. there are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur. the first was the invasion of iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in iraq and empowered iran. the second was the arab spring, which created huge vacuums in libya and in syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. and the third was the recent deal allowing iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world. now, i say this as someone who spent five years in the pentagon and who opposed the war in iraq, whose son fought in iraq, i've fought in vietnam. but if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with china. and we need to do this because of their aggression in the region. we need to do it because of the way they treat their own

because we don't play the game. and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave. if you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the united states and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs. and if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up. it has gone down. and i think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what i'm saying.","class":1,"tokens":[-0.7750806808,2.4217448235,1.0441664457,1.2245099545,-1.6877322197,0.0302972738,2.613871336,1.6661543846,0.0891251564,1.2944860458,-0.9987930059,1.1902490854,-0.6606901884,-0.6505641937,-2.3468444347,1.2705210447,1.4616440535,0.2592178285,1.5721331835,-0.1526540965,-1.2737270594,0.5496040583,-1.5867612362,0.25161165,3.2677650452,-0.1579788029,-0.3256592155,0.9890344739,-0.2015806288,-0.5514699817,1.5578707457,-1.3023096323,0.6836931705,1.4623403549,1.6958431005,0.8608400822,0.4089457095,0.2991724908,0.290540278,0.040440727,0.6039516926,0.7985295057,-0.4222654402,1.6164594889,-0.3023750484,-0.7027750611,1.444425106,0.5605861545,-0.7729709148,1.0141808987,1.6135109663,0.9632209539,1.3026742935,1.2715784311,0.424361378,1.0508834124,-1.4576089382,-1.4310770035,0.3413045108,1.5654945374]},{"index":993,"text":"ok.

what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace american capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from

secretary clinton never, ever has. in fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with wall street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9\/11. i believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition. there's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages. and the worst type of concentration, secretary clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot. and that's why today you still cannot support, as i do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we

israel.","class":1,"tokens":[0.3055105805,0.0245272648,1.4433678389,-0.2282015979,3.7246975899,2.3106975555,-1.3217519522,3.0168099403,-1.3466193676,1.8758506775,-1.2760397196,-0.982276082,0.8633113503,1.0551536083,-2.477796793,-0.6587082148,0.5131858587,1.5307397842,3.2357909679,-0.0350623131,2.7741324902,0.5873061419,0.4883313775,1.2340481281,0.9105911851,2.1150298119,-1.2528396845,-1.074319005,0.763170898,1.3963747025,1.0693496466,0.9359081388,-1.2221095562,-0.6118625998,1.2196360826,1.1986835003,-2.922013998,0.0008319164,-2.9350335598,-0.1630123407,-0.9394779801,-0.2127305269,-0.983525157,-0.2483106405,-0.0302177053,0.8898285627,-0.6127823591,0.5106438398,-0.2177611589,1.3395953178,-0.8032640219,-0.6985233426,0.5431905985,-1.6296038628,-1.9521462917,-2.9533042908,-0.3223558068,-0.2026183605,1.4529663324,-0.7359665036]},{"index":1033,"text":"in

freedom america has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of america.","class":1,"tokens":[0.625767827,-0.9682372808,0.2004647404,-0.1845102459,0.2161005586,-0.4365082681,-1.5420758724,0.7475309968,-0.2283487618,0.9246354699,-0.8919404745,-0.1211309209,0.8054198027,0.1240734234,-2.711196661,-1.6213619709,0.0818041936,1.4039493799,-0.1173102036,-0.0148872444,0.2319124937,0.4840754867,-0.1116889045,-0.070844233,-0.5090738535,0.603731215,-1.4207898378,0.3822281063,1.3438562155,0.2227759361,-0.2710725963,-1.2810729742,-0.5829213262,-0.7347795367,0.5419652462,-0.3238740861,0.052090168,0.8661877513,-0.7572658658,-0.1614315659,-0.604717195,0.7484830022,0.6000354886,0.8656974435,-0.0604312085,0.1944692582,-0.0407022089,0.8955465555,1.163492322,1.4588073492,1.1154216528,-1.1538584232,1.2450500727,0.4499285519,1.3944768906,-1.3298461437,0.5159025192,1.2279186249,-0.3656811714,0.3356243968]},{"index":1233,"text":"wolf,

people there so they can fight for themselves. in the eastern part of europe, make sure that finland and the baltics know that if the russians move, we move. in syria, yes, a no-fly zone in the north on the turkish border, a no-fly zone on the south on the jordanian border. anybody flies in the first time, maybe they can fly out. they fly in there a second time, they will not fly out. and it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be. and it also sends many messages in the middle east that we're still involved. saudi arabia, cut off the funding for the radical clerics, the ones that preach against us. but they're fundamentally our friends. jordan, we want the king to reign for 1,000 years. egypt, they have been our ally and a moderating force in the middle east throughout their history. in the groups -- in the countries of the gulf states of bahrain, the cleveland clinic is opening an operation. clearly we see the same with them. and in israel, we have no better ally in the world, and no more criticizing them in public, we should support them. and finally china, china doesn't own the south china sea, and i give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more. and in the trade agreement, the tpp, it's critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the chinese. they are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend. and finally, i will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics. when the fall comes, and we run against hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected. i have two 16-year-old girls, and i want this country to be strong. we make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble. we must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid. i served in washington as the chairman of the budget committee, and we got the budget balanced. and in ohio, as the ceo, and guess what, we have got to have a ceo mentality and a way to beat hillary clinton and the democracies in the fall. and our ideas have to add up. they have to be solid. and people have to know we have the confidence to lead america. and as president, i will lead this country, as i have before in washington and in ohio, and will return both on domestic and international affairs. and i appreciate the

dana, the premise of your question is not accurate. i'm very proud to have joined with conservatives in both the senate and the house to reform how we target bad guys. and what the usa freedom act did is it did two things. number one, it ended the federal government's bulk collection of phone metadata of millions of law-abiding citizens. but number two in the second half of it that is critical. it strengthened the tools of national security and law enforcement to go after terrorists. it gave us greater tools and we are seeing those tools work right now in san bernardino. and in particular, what it did is the prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. when you had a terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily land lines. the usa freedom act expands that so now we have cell phones, now we have internet phones, now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys. you know what the obama administration keeps getting wrong is whenever anything bad happens they focus on law-abiding citizens instead of focusing on the bad guys. we need to focus on radical islamic terrorists and we need to stop them before they carry out acts of terror.","class":1,"tokens":[0.0997765064,0.0438284203,0.2748816013,-0.120660916,0.6570192575,1.7818207741,0.6093209982,-0.1931624711,-3.5141830444,-0.3041462004,-0.5334070921,-1.8378823996,2.292028904,3.0854551792,-0.776373446,0.7947263122,-0.2580085993,-0.3679617941,-1.7995424271,-1.8073846102,1.5519897938,0.0054636532,-0.9773555398,-0.8172349334,-0.0575377345,1.7312164307,1.0533125401,-1.5862294436,2.5295619965,-1.3417272568,0.8328926563,0.5764521956,-1.1218111515,0.9945819378,0.8773437142,0.4720065892,-0.5112552643,0.6570906639,-1.4566833973,0.3194710612,1.9098814726,1.7500953674,0.1629370451,2.0852630138,-3.2706010342,0.0371395573,0.597296536,0.1220141351,-0.729709208,-0.3637040854,0.8943783045,-2.0529167652,-0.8177193999,0.2434286475,-2.0582232475,-0.9081164598,0.6431063414,-1.0407761335,-0.8107420206,0.5283130407]},{"index":1394,"text":"no

lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking. each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture. you know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down. or a young woman who had been performing at president obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member. and, of course, i met the mothers of eric garner and tamir rice, and michael brown and trayvon martin and so many of them who have lost their children. so, your original question is the right question. and it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer. it's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential. and that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.","class":0,"tokens":[0.9322313666,1.3157767057,-1.8947719336,-0.368663162,-0.7386407256,-0.3447208107,1.188346386,-0.1746239662,-0.816541791,-0.0467786044,1.4780827761,-0.6474072933,-0.4532916248,-0.1884089559,-1.6139606237,-0.292814821,3.7516646385,0.5522941947,-0.107611984,2.577288866,1.3274356127,1.4074115753,-0.6009792089,-0.8926097155,0.8881493211,1.9755572081,0.1282577813,-0.0707806051,0.0799723044,-1.4068464041,1.7257122993,0.8532950878,-2.3840010166,-0.3659031987,1.4461970329,1.4782916307,0.0773322284,1.8118284941,-1.801022172,1.2545268536,-1.7877782583,1.4995492697,-0.1330471486,0.8106710315,-0.6962456703,-0.6218116879,-2.2211277485,-0.6431705356,-1.1429270506,1.7449373007,-0.4712516367,3.1868832111,3.0902190208,0.8226006031,0.7307172418,-0.5201637149,-0.7547623515,2.2668480873,1.8592739105,1.4768966436]},{"index":1521,"text":"i

because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating, or you're going to be bankrupt again. and, the problem with puerto rico is it's economy is not growing. it has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of florida, and all over the country. they're coming to the mainland from puerto rico because the economy there is not growing, it's too expensive to do business there. the tax rate is too high. the government regulations are too extensive. this year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next. so, i think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again. if the economy of puerto rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments. so, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland. they're united states citizens, they're obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a puerto rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust. and, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job. their previous governor, louis fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that

support our partners in nato, and we have to send a very clear message to putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. the best way to do

importantly, here at home, i think there are three things that we have to get right. we have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information. that now includes the internet, because we have seen that isis is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence. that means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies. they can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists. we've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning. and we must work more closely with muslim-american communities. just like martin, i met with a group of muslim-americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization. they will be our early warning signal. that's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the republicans have been doing.","class":0,"tokens":[-1.2076079845,0.3847266734,-2.7705910206,-0.1362237036,-0.4982359111,2.0217757225,2.7413527966,-0.2387311906,-0.0175709333,0.0383598357,-2.0609545708,-1.0679107904,-0.0741201788,2.1495265961,-0.0611063913,-0.1883546263,1.0201181173,1.0866641998,0.0446981266,-2.6643364429,2.4552385807,-0.6130726337,1.8066709042,0.6950277686,-0.770142436,-0.4232718647,-0.6577085257,2.3083677292,0.6116713285,0.2819721401,0.7848485112,1.3882366419,0.6540353298,-0.7485706806,-0.1207756996,-0.3193921447,0.9744830728,0.3575512171,-2.4007046223,0.5187624097,0.4680348635,0.7172268629,2.2158894539,1.6039161682,-0.8959835768,0.3491215706,-1.5048773289,0.0795327276,-0.592074275,-0.7184864879,1.9887051582,0.365883708,-0.3296364248,0.9650653005,0.480683893,-1.735706687,-0.7527091503,-0.9589347839,0.1047851071,0.8835276961]},{"index":1633,"text":"my

available not just for her, but for all of our children. i have spent a very long time -- my entire adult life -- looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her god-given potential. i've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and i've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy. at the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them. and then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one. right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. so i have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families. and i want to do more to help us balance family and work. i believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but i also believe it's about

you very much, anderson. and thanks to all the viewers who tuned in tonight. i think what you did see is that, in this debate, we tried to deal with some of the very tough issues facing our country. that's in stark contrast to the republicans who are currently running for president. what you have to ask yourself is: who amongst us has the vision for actually making the changes that are going to improve the lives of the american people? who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done? now, i revere my late mother, and she gave me a lot of good advice. but one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was, you know, the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down. it's whether you get back up. america's been knocked down. that great recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth disappeared. and although we've made progress, we're standing but not running the way america needs to. my mission as president will be to raise incomes for hard-working middle-class families and to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain i was raised with: if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. please join me in this campaign. please come and make it clear that america's best days are still ahead. thank you very

with respect to syria, i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made. the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria. the agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to. you know, the russians wanted to buy time. are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible. but i would add this. you know, the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution. at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together. this is incredibly complicated, because we've got iran as a big player, in addition to russia. we have saudi arabia, turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. this is one of the areas i've disagreed with senator sanders on, who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria, which i think would be a grave mistake. putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me. trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. so let's support what secretary kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition. and remember, the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups. so as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria, turkey, lebanon, jordan, and the like. so we've got some

we are doing away with private health insurance premiums. so, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to blue cross, or blue shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes,
